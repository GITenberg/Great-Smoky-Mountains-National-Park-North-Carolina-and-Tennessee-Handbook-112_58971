<h4>The National Park Handbook Series</h4>
<p>National Park Handbooks, compact introductions to
the great natural and historic places administered by
the National Park Service, are designed to promote
understanding and enjoyment of the parks. Each is intended
to be informative reading and a useful guide
before, during, and after a park visit. More than 100
titles are in print. This is Handbook 112. You may
purchase the handbooks through the mail by writing to
Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing
Office, Washington, DC 20402.</p>
<h4>About This Book</h4>
<p>Great Smoky Mountains National Park straddles the
North Carolina-Tennessee border and encompasses the
climax of the Appalachian Mountain System. Major attractions
are the mountains themselves, the preserved
structures and lore of mountain folklife, stupendous displays
of flowering plants and shrubs, fall colors, wild
animals, superb hiking opportunities, and gorgeous
rivers, streams, and waterfalls. This handbook is published
in support of the National Park Service&rsquo;s management
policies and interpretive programs at the park.
Part 1 gives a brief introduction to what you may find
in a leisurely visit to the park; Part 2 outlines the natural
history of the mountains and their valleys; and Part 3
presents concise travel guide and reference materials.</p>

<h3 id="c2">The Appalachians at Their Best</h3>
<p>At first glimpse there appear to be two Smokies: the
mountains&rsquo; wild nature, and the folk life. The mind calls
up both the sweeping mountain vistas whose peaks succeed
peaks to the far horizon and the rustic cabins and
barns set off with the split rail fences of 19th-century
mountain life. The mountains are everywhere, punctuated
by restored settlements, by Cades Cove, Mingus
Mill, Cataloochee, and Little Greenbrier. But this is not
the full story for there are many, many Great Smokies, a
double fistful of which may be just for you. There are as
many Great Smokies as there are people who come here
intent on discovering their secrets: the folklorist&rsquo;s and
amateur historian&rsquo;s Smokies; the trout angler&rsquo;s Smokies;
the Smokies of the backpacker, day-tripper, and trail
walker; the botanist&rsquo;s, ecologist&rsquo;s, and birder&rsquo;s Smokies;
and the automobile tourist&rsquo;s Smokies. Take your pick.</p>
<p>You can walk into the Smokies, into the heart of the
wilderness. You can drive through the Smokies, through
the jewels in the crown of the Appalachian highlands.
You can enter them through North Carolina or through
Tennessee. But you can also enter them through any
strong interest <i>you</i> may have, for there are as many
Smokies as there are ways you can see them. And one
good way to see them is through the eyes of a native son
whose love for these mountains is exceeded only by his
love for people. Such is Glenn Cardwell.</p>
<p>Glenn Cardwell took his aging mother and father
down to the Noah &ldquo;Bud&rdquo; Ogle cabin just after the National
Park Service finished restoring it. Glenn works for the
park and would conduct nature walks at the cabin, so he
wanted to see what his folks would say. They used to live
nearby and his mother&rsquo;s Aunt Cindy and her husband,
Noah, built the cabin just off Cherokee Orchard Road
out of Gatlinburg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; Glenn said, &ldquo;my mother got to
reminiscing not one step off the parking lot and stopped
at every rock and spot in the yard and told a tale. It
must&rsquo;ve taken the better part of an hour just to get her
through the yard and down to the porch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Glenn&rsquo;s mother took one look at the porch and said,
&ldquo;They put the step [a big flat rock] in the wrong place.&rdquo;
And so the restoration team had ... but it was another
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
rock that bothered Mrs. Cardwell most.</p>
<p>Walking back to the car she stopped dead in her
tracks and said despairingly, &ldquo;What have they <i>done</i> to
Cindy&rsquo;s rock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Glenn had no idea what she meant although he could
see the road cut close to a big boulder. The road had
been relocated but Glenn recalled nothing unusual about
the rock.</p>
<p>His mother, still staring, repeated her question. Glenn&rsquo;s
father shrugged, &ldquo;Looks to me like somebody blowed
hell out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I still couldn&rsquo;t figure out what was bothering my
mother,&rdquo; Glenn said.</p>
<p>But now, in the 1980s, he will tell you that everyone in
the Smokies had scaffolds in their yards back in Aunt
Cindy&rsquo;s day for drying fruits and vegetables for winter
storage. Everyone, that is, but Aunt Cindy. She used the
big boulder across from their cabin, or what used to be
the flat part of it. Many&rsquo;s the time Glenn&rsquo;s mother, as a
little girl, helped Aunt Cindy spread produce to sun dry
on the rock.</p>
<p>Glenn Cardwell is an affable walking encyclopedia of
Smokies life at the time the Smokies changed from a
piece of Tennessee and North Carolina real estate into
our second national park in the East. Stories such as
Glenn&rsquo;s&mdash;and there are many&mdash;supply a compelling human
resonance to this wilderness land. Glenn&rsquo;s enthusiasm is
a bit unusual, because his father was bought out <i>twice</i> by
the Federal government as lands were being acquired for
the park. And each buy-out meant an unplanned relocation
for the family, moving and building anew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think if my mother hadn&rsquo;t had me on the way at the
time of the first buy-out,&rdquo; Glenn said, &ldquo;my father would
have pulled up stakes and gone back to Cumberland,
Virginia, like many, many of our other relatives did.&rdquo; But
the Cardwells stayed on near the park and Glenn embodies
a transition, bridging new and old ways of doing and
seeing things here. His father was bitter at first, but when
he visited the Noah &ldquo;Bud&rdquo; Ogle Cabin years later he
admitted he was glad the park had come along so that
some things remained unchanged. It was nice, he said,
that he and others could still see the land as it had been.</p>
<p>The Great Smokies represented a new direction in
national park policy in the 1920s. The eighteen national
parks then in existence in the West had been created
from lands already owned by the Federal government.
The Smokies lands authorized for park purchase beginning
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
in 1926 were all in private ownership in more than
6,600 tracts. The lion&rsquo;s share was owned by eighteen
timber and pulpwood companies, but 1,200 other tracts
were farms. Worse, there were also more than 5,000 lots
and summer homes. Many of these had been won in
promotion schemes and their owners had never bothered
to pay taxes on them. This created an awesome land
acquisition headache.</p>
<p>The Federal government would not purchase land for
national parks in those days, so in 1927 the Tennessee
and North Carolina legislatures each provided for appropriation
of $2 million to purchase the land. Already, $1
million had been pledged. The legislation also created
State Park Commissions in each state to handle the
buying. The John D. Rockefeller family supplemented
the fund drive with a $5 million donation. This was
considered one of the biggest and most important accomplishments
of the entire national park movement. The
two states eventually purchased the needed lands and
donated them to the Federal government.</p>
<p>Ten years of dogged, full-scale activity and several
more years of tying up loose ends were required to get the
acquisition job done. Despite this tremendous impact of
human land use in the Smokies, however, about forty
percent of the park&rsquo;s 209,000 hectares (517,000 acres)
constitutes the East&rsquo;s most extensive virgin forest. Forest
recovery is now well underway throughout the park
despite the former blight left by logging and subsequent
forest fires, and landslides, and other forms of erosion.</p>
<p>At one time no sharp edge separated two aspects of
nature in the Great Smokies: man and the wilderness.
Cherokee Indians lived here in ways ironically similar to
those of the whites who would soon displace them. They
cultivated crops, hunted, believed in one god, practiced
a democratic form of government, and lived not in
teepees but in mud-and-log structures. &ldquo;The place of
blue smoke,&rdquo; <i>Shaconage</i>, they called this mountain hunting
ground. And here amidst the haze lived also the spirit
of their people; it, too, could not be divorced from the
land itself. Treaty after treaty saw the Cherokees lose
more and more homeland, up to and finally including the
Smokies. In one of the great human tragedies that blots
American history they were forcibly removed westward,
&ldquo;relocated&rdquo; to Oklahoma via the &ldquo;Trail of Tears.&rdquo; One
fourth of the people died along the way. A few Cherokees
had resisted removal, staying behind in small groups
and hiding out in the mountains. Troops could not relocate
them because they couldn&rsquo;t <i>locate</i> them. Later the Cherokees
were allowed to return and reclaim the borders
of their old homeland. They live there today on the
Cherokee Reservation.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>It is difficult now to appreciate the pressure once
exerted on the Appalachian highlands by human settlement.
Back when land meant livelihood to a nation of
agrarian people, the gradual pressure from the eastern
coast, across the Piedmont, reached the Appalachian
chain. The shortage of arable lands forced people into
and finally onto the mountains in search of a plot of
ground that would produce a livelihood. And so settlement
came to the Great Smokies, gradually working its
way up the mountainsides to the limits of cultivation.
Grazing was eventually pushed beyond those limits all the
way up the mountain to the balds. Combined overgrazing,
overfishing, destructive logging practices, and overhunting
would soon turn dense wilderness into a ravaged landscape.
The National Park was authorized in 1926, established
for protection in 1930, and established for development
in 1934. And now, about 50 years later, wilderness
is again in ascendancy, as field naturalist Napier Shelton
amply testifies as he takes you exploring in Part Two of
this handbook.</p>
<p>The wilderness richness here is both astounding and
close at hand. Richness? There are more species of
salamanders here&mdash;22&mdash;than in any other part of the
world. In the lush density of the Smokies forests there
are more tree species than in all of Northern Europe. It is
thought that this sheer density of forest cover and its
attendant transpiration help account for the &ldquo;misty&rdquo; character
for which the Great Smoky Mountains are named.</p>
<p>This forest richness continues to unfold for present-day
biologists, as the recent discovery of the paper birch in
the Smokies attests. It had long been held that this
northern species did not occur in Tennessee. Its range
generally swings southward into New Jersey and then
simply jumps along the Appalachians, appearing here
and there as elevation and other conditions simulate
northerly climes.</p>
<p>Peter White, plant ecologist with the National Park
Service&rsquo;s Uplands Biological Field Research Laboratory
in the Smokies, discovered several of the trees one day
when he went out to verify a paper birch sighted by three
North Carolina graduate students two years before. &ldquo;It
was located on a manway or unmaintained trail,&rdquo; White
said, &ldquo;right on the trail, one of the steepest in the park. So
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
if you knew what you were looking for there was no
missing it. Actually what we have here in the Smokies is
called the mountain paper birch, which may or may not
be a different species than the classic white birch which
would be called the true or typical paper birch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>White is fascinated with unusual plant occurrences. A
major passion of his here in the Smokies is to track down
the mystery of the circumpolar twinflower, <i>Linnaea</i>,
collected from &ldquo;the mountains of Sevier County in
Tennessee&rdquo; by amateur botanist Albert Ruth in 1891.
This is the only report of the plant south of certain bogs
in West Virginia, and White hopes to verify it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ruth misidentified this <i>Linnaea</i> as partridgeberry and
it wasn&rsquo;t known about until 1934, when it came to the
University of Tennessee with the Ruth Collection from
Texas,&rdquo; White said. &ldquo;Jack Sharp at the university recognized
its true identity and its significance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Ruth Collection came to Tennessee because the
university&rsquo;s plant herbarium was destroyed by fire in the
1920s and the university sought to build it up again. The
twinflower was discovered by the great botanist Carl
Linnaeus in Finland and named for him by a friend. It
occurs from Eurasia to North America as a northern
species, hence the &ldquo;circumpolar&rdquo; description.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are pluses and minuses to believing the plant
came from here,&rdquo; White explained. &ldquo;Ruth was a careful
field botanist with a good eye, and many plants are
named for him. He collected many species for the first
time. But we also know from his collections that some of
his labels are vague.&rdquo;</p>
<p>White&rsquo;s quest for the elusive twinflower growing far
south of its normal range symbolizes an aspect of the
Smokies. The park has been designated an International
Biosphere Reserve. As one writer put it: All the world of
ecology comes to the Great Smokies ... Scientists and
students come to observe the richness and density of life
forms; the misplaced species; the dramatic impacts of
catastrophic landslides and fire scars; and the unknowns,
those tantalizing areas of knowledge still withholding
their secrets despite careful scrutiny. What really happened
here during the glacial periods? Where were the
trees then? How much forest burning did Cherokees
use for game and vegetation management purposes before
Europeans came? Speculations aside, what is the
true story behind grassy balds? What are the seasonal
migration patterns of the juncos that stay in the park
year-round? These remain questions stirring the expert
and amateur alike to earnest inquiry.</p>

<p>Perhaps you may come to make one of these questions
your own. Nature, it turns out, is an unfolding
process. It is a continuous coping, albeit gradual, with
change, so that our knowledge always remains limited
and there is ever much more to learn. If you have questions,
do feel free to ask them. Ask them of a ranger, a
naturalist, or the people behind the counters at the visitor
centers. But the more closely you observe the nature
of things here in the Smokies, the more likely your questions
will be to draw a blank. Don&rsquo;t be disappointed by
this. Be encouraged: your question without an answer,
should you pursue it, might hold the key to understanding
some facet of the natural world tomorrow. But you
will have to look at the Smokies, really look with honest
and inquiring eyes, to stump the likes of Glenn Cardwell
and Peter White or any number of other people you
might meet here in the park.</p>
<p>All questions aside, however, one thing is certain:
millions have come here in pursuit of recreation and
gone away fully satisfied, to return again and again.

<h3 id="c4">A One-day Walk to Maine</h3>
<p>Every spring a number of enterprising people set out to
walk more than 3,000 kilometers (2,000 miles) on the
Appalachian Trail from Georgia to Maine. Those who
finish typically arrive some four months later. You can
experience nearly the same thing&mdash;in terms of the natural
history and particularly forest cover&mdash;in a single day
by hiking from the lowlands to the crest of the Smokies.
Because of the climatic change accompanying this gain
in altitude, as much as 1,500 meters (5,000 feet), such a
walk can take you, as it were, through the oak and pine
forests of northern Georgia, the oak-hickory forests of
central Virginia, the northern hardwoods of Massachusetts,
and into the spruce-fir forests of Maine and Canada.
And along the way you get many glimpses of the
natural processes that shape and control the national
park&rsquo;s marvelous assemblage of life.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not quite ready for such a long, hard climb,
why not join me for an armchair ascent of the mountains?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s early on a summer morning and the sky is clear,
but knowing the frequency of rain in the Smokies, we
tuck ponchos into our packs. As our boots crunch
pleasantly on the gravel of an old mountain road, we
listen to the neighboring stream and look at the forested
hollow it drains. Just a few decades ago farm children
played in the stream, and cornfields bordered the road.
Now we can enjoy the stream in the shade of yellow-poplar
trees that now stand thick and straight where the
grain once did.</p>
<p>Around a bend the stream gradient steepens and so
does the road. We are still in young forest; here it grows
where cattle formerly grazed or lumbermen felled its
giant ancestors. For some time we labor upwards, the
road becoming a trail and a few big trees appearing along
the tumbling creek. Then, rather suddenly, there is a
striking difference in the environment. We have crossed
the line into primeval forest, into territory where the
axman has not been and most of the trees are big. This is
Great Smokies virgin cove forest, a type unrivaled in the
northern hemisphere for combined variety and size of
trees. Here it is cool, shady, and moist. The tree trunks
shoot high above into the canopy, which intercepts most
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
of the sunlight and seems to enclose us in a private world.
The ground around us is covered with the greenery of
small plants. We hear bird songs but cannot see the
singers.</p>
<p>The peace and grandeur of the forest are interrupted
by a slight movement off to our right. In the leaves
beneath a large, rotting log a tiny shrew restlessly sniffs
with its long nose. It moves in short thrusts through the
dead leaves, searching with a fierce intensity for worms,
crickets, or any animal small enough to overcome. Impelled
by hunger, this normally nocturnal animal has been
emboldened by the shadiness to venture into the cove
forest&rsquo;s subdued daylight. The shrew is just one infinitesimal
part of the great forest, in which thousands of living
things seek the energy and nutrients needed for survival.
The shrew hunts, as it were, a fragment of the sun&rsquo;s
energy, transmitted through plants and then through the
small plant-eating creatures that it preys upon.</p>
<p>Crossing a log bridge below a waterfall, we see fish
darting under boulders. Spray from the falls drifts over us
and onto the dark thickets of rhododendron crowding
the stream banks. We try to keep the cool water in our
minds as we start up the long switchbacks ascending the
valley&rsquo;s south-facing slope. Trees of the cove forest, buckeye,
hemlock, sugar maple, and their many associates,
gradually become scarcer, and oaks and hickories become
the dominant trees. Halfway up the slope we have climbed
from coolness into warmth. Here in the more open oak
forest, the sun beams down through the foliage, heating
the ground and air.</p>
<p>A few gulps from the canteen and we can face the last
switchbacks up the slope and onto a sunstruck, rocky
ridge. The sun has real authority here. Winding more
gradually upward along this ridge, the trail now takes us
beneath pines, trees that are adapted to such hot, dry
situations. If it weren&rsquo;t for the trail, we would have a
tough time making our way through the thickets of
mountain-laurel spread beneath the scattered pines. A
towhee, lover of such thickets, calls its name as we pass.
In one stretch we go through a brown patch of dead
pines. After several mild winters, southern pine beetles
have multiplied and feasted here. If the next winter is not
cold enough to kill most of the beetle larvae, the patch of
dead pines may increase greatly in size.</p>
<p>The trail now slants off onto the north side of the
ridge. Right away the air is somewhat cooler here where
part of the day the ridgetop shields it from the sun. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
pines quickly disappear, and beeches, yellow birches,
maples, and buckeyes form the forest. You New Englanders
should now feel quite at home, among these tree species
that accompany us all the way across the mountain&rsquo;s
north and east flank. Then, as we approach the 1,500-meter
(5,000-foot) level, the dark spires of scattered spruces
begin to appear, signaling the nearness of the Smokies&rsquo;
crowning forest.</p>
<p>But before we make the final ascent, let&rsquo;s take a short
detour to a nearby knob, which promises a spectacular
view, a welcome visual release after being shut in so long
by foliage. Going up the side of the knob, we quickly
leave the forest and begin tunneling through dense thickets
of rhododendron and mountain-laurel. Trees don&rsquo;t
grow here at all. On top, the shrubs become smaller and
we can look out over them. Perched on the end of a
spur from the side of a giant valley, we look up to high
ridges on both sides and down to a stream far below. Is it
our imagination, or do we really hear that stream whispering
to us of the humid, secret world way down there
under the big trees? For many minutes we are lost in
contemplation of the Smokies&rsquo; green-blue spaces.</p>
<p>The crack of thunder suddenly wakens us from our
reverie. A bank of clouds, dark underneath and contorted
with churning air, is rolling over the ridges and
into the head of the valley. The clouds shoot lightning
toward the slopes below. Hypnotized by the spectacle
we remain rooted to our rocks until the first drops fall,
then we pull on our ponchos, determined to greet the
storm. Soon the valley view is blotted out by boiling
clouds. We and a circle of shrubs, both whipped by rain
and wind, are all that exist in the world. Our foolhardiness
on this exposed knob is soon revealed as lightning
flashes so near that its crackling sound is almost instantaneous.
We hurry down the trail, now a small torrent
where it tunnels through the rhododendrons, and in a
few minutes we reach safer ground. We eat our lunch
under sheltering hemlocks. When we sense the end of
the storm, we head toward our day&rsquo;s goal, the top of the
Smokies. The deciduous forest rapidly turns into a
coniferous one, the beech, birch, maple, buckeye, and
others giving way to a nearly solid stand of spruce and fir.
This is an enchanted forest. Carpets of mosses and ferns,
struggling, as it were, for growing space, make delicate
patterns on the forest floor. Limber-stemmed shrubs lift
round or toothed leaves to the pale, post-storm light
filtering through the thick evergreen foliage of the trees
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
above. Out of the stillness, like the voice of some tiny
fairy, comes the tinkling medley of a winter wren. We
stop and listen. We watch a drop of water fall from the
tip of a fern. We feel the coolness, a coolness born of
altitude. We have reached Maine right here in the Smokies.</p>
<p>A short distance beyond, the trail breaks out onto the
top of a cliff, opening to us the whole breadth of the
mountains. This is our final reward; and as we sit here we
see, without knowing it, a summary of our day&rsquo;s experience.
We see landslide scars on the mountainside that
probably came during a storm like the one we just
experienced, when the earth, heavy with water and lying
thinly over the smooth rock beneath, could no longer
hang on and slipped in a crashing avalanche down the
slope; like the pine beetle, landslides are one of the many
natural forces that challenge the forest&rsquo;s powers of recuperation.
Chimney swifts pick insects from the air and
we hear the chatter of a red squirrel interrupted in its
hunt for cones. Like the shrew, each in its own special
way is busy gaining the fuel to stay alive. Each, through
its interaction with plants and animals, affects the total
fabric of Smokies life. Far below, the trees of a cove
forest march up a stream valley; on the slopes above
them spreads a mantle of oaks. A narrow ridge far down
and off to the right bears the dark green of pines. Nearer,
we see the ragged lower edge of the spruce-fir forest,
where it fingers into the northern hardwoods below it.
But we sense an overall unity because each kind of
forest merges into the next, creating an unbroken mantle
that lies over all the ridges as far as the eye can see.</p>
<p>There is no true alpine tundra in the Smokies, such
as we might find atop certain mountains in New York
and New England and atop many mountains in the West.
But alpine experiences aplenty await us here for the
climbing. They can be had on ridges, peaks, and, even
pinnacles, from atop which we gaze out over a forested
sea of peaks. It is a rare reminder of the mantle of
forest that once lay unbroken over the eastern United
States. It is often said that when Europeans first
encountered America, a squirrel could walk from the
Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi without touching the
ground!</p>
<p>Clouds drift over the mountain waves. Like the clouds
of many yesterdays, they have dropped their burden of
excess moisture on the forests, maintaining the wetness
that encourages the lush plant growth of the Smokies.
Then, through a break in the clouds, the sun finally
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
shines, sending renewed charges of energy into the forest
and ultimately through all the life of the forest. Much of
the pattern of forest types is determined by the way the
sun&rsquo;s rays strike the mountain slopes. Through changes
in its daily duration and height in the sky the sun makes
the seasons. Through its powers to evaporate ocean
water and provide the energy that moves air, it can even
be said to bring the rain itself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A hike from Cades Cove to Clingmans
Dome simulates walking
from North Georgia to Maine.
You will begin in Cades Cove
amidst oak and pine forests
which also grow in northern
Georgia. Your walk will end atop
Clingmans Dome in spruce-fir
forests characteristic of Maine
and Canada. In between you will
hike beneath the canopies of oak-hickory-red
maple forests that
characterize Virginia, and the
northern hardwoods of Massachusetts.
The reason for this localized
insight into the whole of
the eastern United States forest
types is the vertical rise of the
Great Smoky Mountains. The
Smokies&rsquo; highest peaks stand
1,500 meters (5,000 feet) above
its lowlands.</p>
<p>The axiom is this: here in the
Smokies, elevation gain simulates
a shift to more northerly latitudes.
Of course, this is a generalization.
On an actual hike from Cades
Cove to Clingmans Dome you
would have to detour a lot to take
in all the variety of eastern U.S.
forest types. But all except true
alpine tundra are here, although
not laid out in a straight line.</p>
<p>In rough attempts to measure the
Smokies&rsquo; <i>local</i> climates, the rule
of thumb is that spring advances
up the mountains. At lower elevations,
for example, spring
beauty blooms by early March.
At 1,500 meters (5,000 feet) elevation,
however, it may still be in
full bloom two to three months
later.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>Remarkably, the Smokies provide
a plant laboratory encompassing
most of the eastern U.S.
major forest vegetation types.
This, and the fact that virgin
forests are rare in the East, make
it no wonder that the Great
Smoky Mountains National Park
has been designated an International
Biosphere Reserve.</p>
<p>This international recognition of
and commitment to preserving
the Smokies underscores the
park&rsquo;s wealth of natural history.</p>
<p>You need not be an expert to
observe this. Sharp eyes and
curiosity will in themselves unfold
great portions of this natural
history lore for you to ponder.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>A degree of romance or mystique
surrounds the cove hardwood
forest. The name was used as
early as 1905 in professional
forestry literature, but was probably
coined much earlier, perhaps
in the days of settlement.</p>
<p>The coves share all of their predominant
trees with the neighboring
plant communities, and
no common animal or plant is restricted
to cove forest. The key to
its recognition is <i>variety</i>, particularly
in the make-up of the canopy,
the name given to the roof
level of any woodland. Cove forest
is not restricted literally to
topographic flats and hollows; it
may also occur on steep slopes,
where soil moisture conditions
are suitable.</p>
<p>In its best development, cove
forest may sustain 20-25 tree
species tangling branches far
overhead. Look for white ash,
sugar maple, magnolia, American
beech, silverbell, and basswood.
If most of these are present,
with or without buckeye,
holly, yellow birch, and hemlock,
you are being treated to cove
hardwood scenery.</p>
<p>Oaks, hickories, red maple and
yellow-poplar (tulip tree) will also
be present, but these widespread
species are not really useful in
settling the question. One often
workable rule of thumb is the
presence of yellow-wood, but this
small tree is absent from the cove
hardwood forest community in
many parts of the park.</p>
<p>Many of today&rsquo;s typical cove
hardwood trees have also been
found as fossils in rocks of
Cretaceous age in the eastern
United States. This match up&mdash;and
the recognition that the
southern mountains have been
continuously available for land
plant growth since Dinosaur
Days&mdash;has given plant geographers
much food for thought.
Cove forest is now plausibly regarded
as a very ancient mixture
of species. Probably, it was the
ancestor of several other widespread
forest communities. Perhaps
it was the haven of refuge
sought by many plants and animals
during the Pleistocene
glacial period. Its significance
today is its wealth of species composition
and its heritage&mdash;millions
of years of forest evolution. We
are fortunate that significant
stands of this forest type survive
uncut in the Great Smoky
Mountains.</p>
<p>A great benefit of these rich, lush
forests for hikers is the refreshing
coolness they afford on hot
summer days. Many people have
described them as &ldquo;green cathedrals&rdquo;
because of the coolness,
rest, and peace they seem to
engender.</p>

<h3 class="interlude">Forest Openings: The Balds</h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i020.jpg" alt="Bald" width="662" height="900" />
</div>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>Most mountains show mosaic
patterns of vegetation noticeable
at a distance, or on scenic
postcards. In the Smokies high
country this zoning is conspicuous.
These mountains rival the
Rockies for all such contrasts,
except for naked rock above
timberline.</p>
<p>There is no climatic treeline&mdash;roughly
an elevation above which
trees cannot survive&mdash;in the
Smokies. But two important treeless
communities, called &ldquo;balds&rdquo;
by the early settlers, give this
above-timber effect here.</p>
<p>The baldness is not that of bare
rock, but rather a mountain-top
interruption to the forest cover.
The two types, grass balds and
heath balds, are alike only in
appearance from a distance, and
in their preference for mountain
summits.</p>
<p>The Cherokees wove the balds
into their religion and folklore.
Mountaineers grazed stock
on the grass balds and cursed the
heath balds as &ldquo;slicks&rdquo; or &ldquo;hells.&rdquo;
Botanists began to publish explanations
for these balds a
century ago but you can still formulate
your own theory because
there are no agreed-upon answers.
The more careful the
study, the more puzzles arise. But
the key in both cases seems to be
<i>disturbance</i>, the successive
destruction of generations of tree
seedlings.</p>
<p>For heath balds the most obvious
tree-killing agent is fire and so fire
was advanced as an explanation
for their origin. Shrubs can burn
to the ground and grow back
quickly, sprouting from their
roots. Mountain laurel, rhododendron,
blueberry, huckleberry,
and sand myrtle all do this. It was
theorized that where fire knocks
out the tree layer, there are the
heath balds. But the rub is that
some balds show no signs of fire
and yet are not nursing young
trees.</p>
<p>Landslides eliminate trees, and
winter winds may also discourage
tree growth. Heath balds persevere
where slopes are steep,
soil is peaty and acidic, and the
elevation tops 1,200 meters
(4,000 feet).</p>
<p>Today the grass balds are a mosaic
of shrubs, grasses, and young
trees. Open patches may be clearly
dominated by grasses but the
total number of plant species present
on grass balds is greater
than the number present on
heath balds.</p>
<p>Explanations of the origin of grass
balds have been much debated
but no theory has been accepted
for them all. We do know that
most grass balds were used as
high elevation pastures in the
1800s and early 1900s, and when
the park was established the
grass balds were more open than
today. Most Southern Appalachian
grass balds are being
quickly invaded by trees and
shrubs. The National Park Service
is developing plans to keep
two Smokies balds open. Despite
their appearance, grassy balds
have no floristic relation to true
alpine or arctic tundra vegetation.</p>

<p class="pcap">The sundew, a bog plant common
in the far North, persists on

swarm.&rdquo;</p>

<img src="images/i020c.jpg" alt="" width="498" height="360" />

<h3 id="c5">The Trout&rsquo;s World</h3>
<p>The rays of the early morning sun bombard the tops of
the trees spread above the headwaters of Forney Creek.
Some penetrate the canopy to make light patches in the
lower layers of the forest. But few break through the
rhododendron thickets along the stream to illuminate its
mossy rocks, its foam, and its clear pools. Down in the
darkness beneath overhanging shrubs, hanging in the
current near the bottom of a pool, a brook trout waits for
the stream to bring it food. With dark mottling along its
back, red spots on its olive sides, and pale orange edging
on its lower fins, the fish is beautiful. It is also small,
about 18 centimeters (7 inches) long, and lean, for it lives
in a harsh environment where food is scarce, the water is
cold and acidic, and floods and thick ice can scour. This
is one of only a few trout in the pool because there is not
enough food for many.</p>
<p>The trout fed little during the night and now its hunger
is acute. Carefully it watches the rippling surface for
insects, spiders, crayfish, salamanders, and worms, or
any animal life caught and carried down by the current.
But nothing appears. It noses up to a rock where earlier
in the summer it had found caddisfly larvae fastened in
their tubular little cases made of tiny pebbles. Now none
are left on the surface of the rock accessible to the trout.
It searches other rocks and eventually finds one caddisfly
larva and a small mayfly nymph, flattened against the
under side. The trout dashes at a small salamander,
which escapes under another rock. Three crayfish also
inhabit the pool but they are too big for this particular
trout to eat.</p>
<p>The trout&rsquo;s hunger increases and still nothing edible
washes over the miniature waterfall at the head of the
pool. But suddenly sand and gravel begin dropping in
and there is a pulsing in the flow of water. Upstream a
bear has crossed and in its crossing it has knocked a
beetle off an overhanging branch. The beetle floats down
one little cataract after another, its legs kicking wildly
and its wet wings vainly buzzing. There is a splash as the
trout strikes. The beetle will sustain it through one more
day.</p>
<p>In contrast to the brook trout&rsquo;s life in the headwaters,
the rainbow trout would appear to have an easier time in
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
the lower reaches of park streams. Here the pools are
larger, the stream gradient is less, the water is less acidic,
and nutrients are more abundant. These conditions allow
more plant and animal life to exist, and therefore create
more food for trout. Also, at these lower elevations,
where the water is deeper, winter ice cannot form so
solidly as higher up. These waters are not exactly teeming
with aquatic life, but they are adequate for rainbow
trout.</p>
<p>Trout do not generally remain active continuously.
They tend to feed in the late afternoon, at night, and
early in the morning, resting at the bottom of a pool
during midday. Both brook and rainbow trout will have
resting sites, day and night, and feeding sites.</p>
<p>A favored feeding site is often the head of the pool,
where a trout will have the first chance to seize insects or
other organisms carried into the pool. It also has the
option of hunting many of the forms of life that live in the
stream with it: insect larvae and nymphs of many kinds,
aquatic beetles and spiders, crayfish, leeches and worms,
water-mites, snails, salamanders, tadpoles, and the smaller
fish.</p>
<p>Among the more common fishes that live in rainbow
trout territory in low elevation, low gradient streams are
sculpins, dace, hogsuckers, river chubs, shiners, and
stonerollers. Hogsuckers, which reach 30 centimeters (a
foot) or more in length, can be seen in many large, quiet
pools. There they search for food on the bottom with
their downward protruding lips. Dace and shiners, members
of the minnow family, are very small fish and some
species are brilliantly colored. The river chub and
stoneroller, also minnows, are larger; the stoneroller
occasionally reaches 28 centimeters (11 inches). Locally
known as &ldquo;hornyhead&rdquo; and enjoyed as a food fish, the
abundant stoneroller may limit the numbers of rainbow
trout in some stretches of stream because of its own
spawning activities. Rainbows lay their eggs on gravelly
areas in early spring. A month or so later, before the
trout eggs have hatched, stonerollers frequently build
their nests in the same places, covering or scattering the
trout eggs in the process. This sort of competition was
probably not expected or considered when rainbows
were introduced to the Smokies; nevertheless, the trout
do manage to perpetuate themselves.</p>
<p>No doubt the most peculiar creature in the lower
sections of park streams is the hellbender, a huge, grayish
salamander with a loose fold of skin along each side.
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
Commonly reaching 30 centimeters (a foot) and occasionally
more than 60 centimeters (2 feet) in length,
hellbenders hide under rocks and debris in swift water
and feed on fish and other animals up to the size of
crayfish. Below elevations of about 500 meters (1,600
feet) smallmouth bass, rock bass, and brightly colored
little darters appear in park waters. Brown trout, an
introduced species that has apparently entered the park
from farther downstream, live in the lower sections of
some streams, and may be found in the headwaters of
some streams. Of the three species of trout in the Smokies,
browns generally prove most difficult to catch.</p>
<p>Since early in this century when rainbow trout were
introduced, and possibly even before, brook trout have
been retreating upstream in these mountains. In the late
19th century, brook trout occurred as low as 500 meters
(1,600 feet); now they are found mostly above 915 meters
(3,000 feet). The effects of logging and competition from
rainbows are the most frequently suggested reasons for
this retreat. Logging, which began on a large scale in the
Smokies about 1900, brought with it many fires. The
resulting exposure to full sunlight caused the warming of
low-elevation sections of streams. Erosion of the denuded
land added heavy loads of sediment to the streams.
These changed conditions, and possibly heavy fishing
pressure, apparently speeded the disappearance of brook
trout from the lower elevations. Rainbows were introduced
and proved able to survive. In the &rsquo;20s and &rsquo;30s it
was noted that rainbows occurred in streams up to about
the upper limit of logging, and that brook trout occupied
streams above that point. Now, however, streams are
once again shaded by forests their full length; but brook
trout, instead of moving back down, seem to have retreated
higher upstream. It appears that the larger, more aggressive
rainbows somehow prevent brook trout from reoccupying
their lost waters.</p>
<p>The National Park Service is concerned for the future
of the Smokies&rsquo; one species of native trout, and especially
for the few isolated populations of brookies that
may still remain unmixed with populations of brook
trout introduced from other parts of the country. On
some streams, waterfalls provide effective barriers to the
advance of rainbow trout, and use of artificial barriers
for this purpose has been considered. Stringent fishing
regulations may help the easily caught brook trout&mdash;and
the gluttonous poaching that sometimes eliminates large
numbers of brook trout from long stretches of a stream
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
must be stopped. This type of management problem,
how to preserve native species and reduce the impact of
exotic ones, is common in national parks. It is only one
aspect of a larger problem: How do we maintain natural
ecosystems in parks? This basic aspect of the national
park idea is difficult to implement in a country where
human influence is so ubiquitous.</p>
<p>Quite a few animals of the Smokies depend on streams
and their organisms without living entirely in them.
They live with one foot in the water and one foot on land,
as it were. Raccoons out hunting at night patrol streams,
alert for frogs, crayfish, and mussels. Mink pursue fish,
crayfish, and other animals underwater, flowing downstream
through the foam as effortlessly as water itself.
Kingfishers perch on overhanging branches to plunge
headfirst after small fish. Their loud, rattling calls can be
heard on the lower courses of many streams. The small
Louisiana waterthrush, a warbler, teeters on rocks in the
torrent, searching for aquatic insects. It nests on stream
banks or behind waterfalls. Its song, a lovely descending
jumble of notes, cascades like the water of its haunts.
Harmless water snakes, mottled brown somewhat like
the water moccasin (which does not occur in the Smokies),
like to sun on limbs or debris near the water. Frogs, fish,
salamanders, and crayfish form most of their diet. Of the
park&rsquo;s few species of frogs, the green frog is the one most
likely to be found in streams. Aquatic turtles are even
less common; most numerous is the snapping turtle, a
wanderer that sometimes reaches the middle elevations
in the park.</p>
<p>Ducks, herons, and other large aquatic birds, scarce in
the park because there are no large bodies of water, do
appear occasionally. On the section of Abrams Creek
that flows through Cades Cove you may surprise a wood
duck or green heron. Though not very productive of
plant food, Fontana Lake on the south border of the park
sometimes serves as a resting place for migrating waterfowl.</p>
<p>Perhaps we humans could be considered semi-aquatic
ourselves, so strongly does water attract us. In the Smokies
people love to visit waterfalls, plunge into favorite swimming
holes, play among the rocks and white water, and
fish up and down the streams. One of my favorite activities
is simple stream-watching. Just pick a sunny rock, sit
down with your lunch, and watch. That&rsquo;s all there is to it.
Trout will eventually grow bold enough to come out of
hiding. Birds fly out of the dense forest to feed in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
sunlit shrubs along the stream. Butterflies wander down
this open avenue, and dragonflies dart after winged prey.
Sometimes the unusual happens. One fine October day
as I was just finishing my sandwich, a little red squirrel
appeared on the opposite shore, edged down a rock to
the water, and plunged in. It drifted with the current and
then scrambled out on a rock near me. A swimming
squirrel I had never expected to see.</p>
<p>In the Smokies you are seldom far from the sound of
water. These tumbling streams&mdash;the Little Pigeon, the
Oconaluftee, Roaring Fork, Hazel Creek, and all their
many brothers&mdash;have voices as various as a hound dog&rsquo;s.
They talk, murmur, shout, and sing, rising and falling in
tone. Porters Creek once actually convinced me that
people were talking and playing guitars on its bank. This
is the soul music of the mountains.</p>

<p>The streams and rivers of the

beauty of the waterways that
have carved their way into the
lush wilderness. More than 300
streams flow throughout the park.
To many of us these streams
mean only one thing, trout. Actually,
more than 70 species of fish
have been collected in the park,
such as chubs, shiners, minnows,
dace, catfish, suckers, sculpins,
darters, and even lamprey.</p>
<p>Trout live in fast-flowing water
where their streamlined bodies
enable them to maintain themselves
in the current, often close
to the stream bottom. Brookies,

water that they are often considered

<p>To rile up trout anglers just assert
that one fly pattern is the best.
But in fly fishing areas such as
the Smokies, a few patterns inevitably
emerge as favorites. Here as
elsewhere, most artificial flies
imitate five varieties of insects
common to most waters: mayflies,
caddisflies, stoneflies,
alderflies, and ants. There are, in
all, about 5,000 sorts of human-tied
flies in existence. Does that
sound overwhelming? Well, there
are probably hundreds of thousands
of varieties of insects
which trout may feed upon at one
time or another. The following
advice will help you narrow your
choice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These are the heaviest and most
beautiful hard-wood forests of
the continent,&rdquo; read a 1901 report
from President Theodore Roosevelt
to Congress. Lumber entrepreneurs
were impressed, and the
Little River watershed was sold
that year for about $9.70 per
hectare ($4.00 per acre)&mdash;all
34,400 hectares (85,000 acres) of
it! Throughout the Smokies, entire
watersheds were staked off
like mining claims. Largest of all
was a timbered plot owned by the
Champion Coated Paper Company.
It included Deep Creek,
Greenbrier Cove, and the headwaters
of the Oconaluftee
River.</p>

</div>
<p>Logging came to the Smokies on
a large scale about 1900. Settlers
had always cut trees here, but the
lumber companies and their
money and methods injected a
major new element. Instead of a
few oxen dragging heavy logs to
mill, the lumber companies introduced
railroads, steam loaders,
and steam skidders on the landscape.
As you drive from Elkmont
toward Townsend along
the park road, you are driving
atop the old railbed that was laid
down by the Little River Logging
Company.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>New towns sprang up: Elkmont,
Crestmont, Proctor, Ravensford,
and Smokemont. These provided
something new to the Smokies, a
cash market. For a time, one egg
would &ldquo;buy&rdquo; a child a week&rsquo;s
supply of candy. Local families
sold farm products to the loggers
and sawmill men.</p>

<h3 class="interlude">Fires and Flooding</h3>
<blockquote>
<div class="img" id="fig55">
<img src="images/i027.jpg" alt="" width="657" height="900" />
<p class="pcap">The devastation seen in the photograph is the aftermath of a fire that was
set by sparks belched out of logging equipment, an unfortunate source of several devastating
fires in logging&rsquo;s heyday.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>The ravages of logging led to
fires, and the fires led to flooding.
Many fires were set by the flaming
sparks from locomotives or
log skidders. More than 20 disastrous
fires took place in the 1920s
alone. A two-month series of fires
burned over parts of Clingmans
Dome, Silers Bald, and Mt.
Guyot. Intense destruction occurred
in the Charlie&rsquo;s Bunion
area of The Sawteeth in 1925.
Hikers on the Appalachian Trail
still see the effects of this fire.</p>
<p>The fires created conditions for
massive flooding. Parched soils
were no longer secured by living
roots and the dense mat of plants
that makes the Smokies world
famous today. Streams and rivers
flooded, carrying unusually heavy
loads of sediment. These conditions
were intolerable for the
native Southern Appalachian
brook trout and apparently
speeded their disappearance from
lower elevations.</p>
<p>Rainbow trout were introduced
and proved able to survive.
More recently brown trout were
successfully introduced. The
brookies now occupy less than
half the territory they did in
the 1930s.</p>
<hr class="dwide" />
<div class="img" id="fig56">
<img src="images/i027a.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="438" />
<p class="pcap">Some flooding is still common
today. This is natural. The
Smokies get their fair share of
rainfall, making seasonal flooding
expected. And every few years
prolonged or bad storms can
cause unusually heavy flooding
of the streams and rivers. Here
you see the Little Pigeon River
in flood near park headquarters
in 1979. Whenever Smokies
streams or rivers are flooded it
is very dangerous to attempt
crossing them. Don&rsquo;t try it.
Revise your itinerary instead.</p>
</div>
<hr class="dwide" />
<p>What about fires today? Lightning-caused
fire is as ancient as
the mountains themselves and
has always been a part of the
forest&rsquo;s life process. Some tree
species actually depend on fire
for regeneration, such as the pin
cherry. And the heath bald
shrubs, such as blueberry and
mountain-laurel, prosper after a
light burn. Fire is necessary as
well to dozens of flowering plants
which quickly seed new forest
openings the fire creates.</p>
<p>We have long viewed fire on wildlands
as a catastrophe, and indeed
it is often a piteous sight.
But the urge to suppress fire completely
sometimes results in other
unsatisfactory conditions. On
many large public land areas
limited wildfires are now allowed
to burn if they don&rsquo;t threaten private
property or human lives.</p>

<h3 id="c6">The Evolution of Abundance</h3>
<p>Diversity is the biological keynote of the Great Smoky
Mountains. Within the national park have been found
about 1,500 species of flowering plants, among which are
some 100 trees. There are around 2,000 fungi, 50 mammals,
200 birds, and 70 fishes, or more than in the fresh
waters of any other national park on our continent. There
are about 80 reptiles and amphibians, among which are
22 salamanders, which is probably as many as can be
found in any similar-sized area in North America. Present
conditions, such as warmth, abundant moisture, and
a diversity of environments brought about by the height
and dissection of the mountains, are partly responsible
for this biotic wealth. But time, the many millions of
years this land has been above the sea and south of the
ice, has also been an important factor. It has been a span
long enough for a great many species of plants and
animals to get here and find a niche and for other species
to evolve in the region. The story of the arrival and
evolution of the present flora and fauna is intimately
linked with the dramatic history of our continent.</p>
<p>We can only guess what life existed here during the
130 million years of the Mesozoic era, because no rocks
from this period exist in the Smokies. But we can imagine
that dinosaurs and primitive birds and mammals
roamed the region, as they did other parts of the continent.
Toward the close of the Mesozoic, flowering plants
evolved and rapidly became the dominant type of vegetation.
We can guess that some of these first magnolias,
elms, and oaks grew right here in the ancestral Smokies.
Newly evolved bees probably helped to pollinate some
of the flowering plants.</p>
<p>The story becomes clearer and the life forms become
more and more familiar to us during the 65 million years
of the Cenozoic, the present era. In the first half of the
Cenozoic, subtropical vegetation grew in the southern
United States and temperate vegetation grew north to
the Arctic. As these plants would indicate by their ability
to grow here, this was a time of warm or mild climates
throughout the Northern Hemisphere. Land bridges
between North America and Eurasia, by way of the
Bering Strait and perhaps Greenland, allowed the spread
of a remarkably homogeneous flora throughout the then-temperate
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
parts of these two continents. The Great
Smokies, with their feet in the South and, as it were, their
head climatically in the North, must have had both
subtropical and temperate vegetation early in the Cenozoic
era.</p>
<p>During the second half of the Cenozoic, a cooling
trend set in. The widespread &ldquo;Arctotertiary&rdquo; vegetation
of the northern latitudes moved southwards through
North America and Eurasia. By the end of the Tertiary,
which includes all but the past two to three million years
of the Cenozoic, the vegetation zones of North America
were probably very similar to those of the present. In the
Smokies the trees probably ranged from southern types,
such as sweetgum, at low elevations through the great
mixture of cove forests and possibly to spruce and fir at
the highest elevations. After a long period of gradual
change in climate, the stage was set for the drastic events
of the Pleistocene.</p>
<p>It is hard for us to imagine what an ice age must have
been like in our country. Perhaps the only way to imagine
it is to visit the Antarctic or one of the great glaciers
in Alaska, and to watch giant slabs of ice fall from those
towering walls. Then ... mentally transport the scene to
the Hudson River valley or to the flatlands of Illinois,
while magnifying the thickness of those glaciers several
times over. Then imagine the surface of that great ice
sheet stretching all the way to northern Canada.</p>
<p>If you had stood near the front of that massive ice
sheet, you would have felt the cold air flowing off it. How
far south that cold, dense air flowed and to what extent it
affected temperatures in the southern states are unanswered
questions. But undoubtedly temperatures were lowered
throughout North America and perhaps farther south.
Some scientists postulate a drop of 5.5 degrees Celsius
(10 degrees Fahrenheit) in mean annual temperatures in
southern United States. The high pressure that developed
over the ice sheet would have pushed storm tracks southward,
increasing precipitation in the South.</p>
<p>Such continental ice sheets advanced at least four
times as climates cooled, and as many times they retreated
during warmer intervals. With each advance and
the consequent cooler, wetter climate, there was undoubtedly
a southward shift of vegetation belts. In the
mountains there would also have been a downward shift
of forest types, particularly those of the higher elevations.
That is, the higher elevation species would begin to grow
down the slope. In sheltered coves temperatures probably
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
did not drop as much as they did higher up or out
in the open lowlands, and soils in coves were deeper
and more fertile. The coves of the Southern Appalachians
thus may have formed a refuge for many temperate
species of plants, including some forced southward
by the spreading ice. This is a factor in today&rsquo;s
biotic richness or abundance in the Smokies.</p>
<p>On top of the Smokies and other high mountains of
the Southern Appalachians, tundra (treeless areas) may
have developed as winter climates became too cold and
windy even for spruce and fir, which is the situation
today on high peaks of the Adirondacks and White
Mountains in New England. Accumulations of blocky
boulders in higher parts of the Smokies resemble block
fields in the northern Appalachians that probably were
formed above timberline in late stages of glaciation.
From the location of block fields, geologists postulate a
treeline in the Smokies somewhere between 900 and
1,500 meters (3,000 and 5,000 feet) elevation during the
last glacial period, some 15,000 to 25,000 years ago. If
islands of tundra did exist in the Southern Appalachians,
it is not likely that tundra mammals would have migrated
from the tundra bordering the ice front through the
intervening forest to reach such Arctic pastures in the
sky. But some birds might have. Water pipits, which
today nest in the Arctic and above timberline on our
Western mountains, might have bred on these patches of
southern tundra. And the few snow buntings which have
been seen wintering on Southern Appalachian balds
may have been returning to ancestral nesting grounds of
the species.</p>
<p>Although Pleistocene tundra in the Smokies is a rather
speculative notion, it seems certain that spruce-fir forest
existed below today&rsquo;s 1,400-meter (4,600-foot) limit. This
supposition is supported by the fact that fossil pollen and
other fragments of spruce and fir have been found in
several lowland bog deposits of the South.</p>
<p>During the last Ice Age the Southern Appalachian
spruce-fir forests and their animals must have been a
richer version of the plant-animal community that exists
in this zone today, for at the peak of the ice advance
northern plants and animals probably could migrate
along a continuous avenue of this boreal forest in the
Appalachians. Bones from cave deposits at Natural Chimneys
in Virginia&rsquo;s Shenandoah Valley indicate that such
northern animals as porcupines, snowshoe hares, pine
martens, fishers, spruce grouse, and gray jays, as well as
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
the now extinct longnosed peccary and giant beaver,
roamed that area 10,000 to 15,000 years ago. The still
existing species mentioned above now live farther north
in the forests of New England and Canada. If such
animals could live during the late Pleistocene at 450
meters (1,500 feet) in Virginia, many and perhaps all of
them might well have lived at higher elevations in the
Smokies. In the case of porcupines, archeological records
from nearby regions in fact support this idea.</p>
<p>After the retreat of the last ice sheet a warm, dry
period set in and caused the development of grasslands
as far east as Ohio. To what extent this change in climate
may have affected the Smokies is not known. But it may
have been responsible for the development of the beech
gaps: as the spruce-fir forests were forced ever higher,
beeches and yellow birches followed in their wake. The
once continuous band of spruce-fir forest through the
Southern Appalachians would then have been broken
into patches as it migrated to higher elevations&mdash;and
disappeared entirely on the lower mountains. Today
such forest is restricted in the Southern Appalachians to
the highest parts of eastern West Virginia, southwestern
Virginia, western North Carolina, and areas in and just
north of the Great Smokies. During the warmer, drier
period following glaciation, boreal forest must have been
even smaller in extent.</p>
<p>Another consequence of warming was the northward
migration of plants and animals into territory vacated by
the ice sheet (north of the Ohio River and Long Island).
The result today in northeastern United States is a broad
patchwork of forest types, each type dominated by a few
species, as in beech-maple or beech-birch-white pine
forests. This stands in contrast to the diversity of the
cove forests from which the migrants extended. Cove
forests still harbor individuals of all these species.</p>
<p>What happens next? Has the Pleistocene epoch really
ended or are we merely between glaciers, awaiting the
next invasion of ice? For the Smokies the question implies
others: Will the forest zones move up or down the
mountainsides? How will this affect animal life?</p>
<p>While terrestrial life in the mountains flourished during
the continent&rsquo;s climatic swings, aquatic life fared
equally well. Within Great Smoky Mountains National
Park live some 70 species of fish. Contrast this with the
number in Shenandoah National Park in the Blue Ridge
of Virginia, which has only about 25 species. Why so
many in the Smokies? The answer parallels the situation
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
for plants and terrestrial animals: diversity of environments
and plenty of time. All the streams of the Smokies
lie within the Tennessee River drainage, which is part of
the Mississippi River drainage. The Tennessee River has
more species of fish than any other river in North America,
because of its many environments (lowland, plateau, and
mountain); the vastness of the Mississippi drainage; its
existence for many millions of years; and its Pleistocene
history. During glacial periods many species of fish were
forced southward by ice and cold glacial water. The
Tennessee River system offered them a refuge just as
Southern Appalachian coves offered a refuge for plants.
Even the Mississippi itself was a less favorable haven
because it received most of the meltwater. In the headwaters
of the Tennessee, the streams of the Smokies thus
benefit from their contact with an ancient, relatively
undisturbed river system. Within the park, stream environments
range from cold and fast to comparatively cool
and slow, with large, deep pools.</p>
<p>While most of the present plant and animal species of
the Smokies have ranges that extend far beyond these
mountains, and while many of these have spread here
from other areas of origin, a few are restricted solely to
the Smokies. This suggests that they may have evolved
here. One such plant is Rugel&rsquo;s groundsel, a member of
the Composite family that grows to about 28 centimeters
(11 inches) high and bears large, cylindrical clusters of
tiny golden flowers. This plant, abundant in the park&rsquo;s
spruce-fir forests, has not been found outside the Smokies.
This suggests that it evolved in the Southern Appalachians
and that after the last glacial period, when connection
with other sections of spruce-fir forest was broken, it
persisted or survived only in the Smokies. By comparison,
the Fraser fir, though most abundant in the Smokies,
also occurs north to southwestern Virginia on the highest
mountains, indicating that it evolved at some earlier,
colder time when spruce-fir forest was more nearly continuous.
The red-cheeked salamander, a striking creature,
is probably the sole vertebrate found exclusively in
the Smokies. Many other species of salamanders, however,
are restricted to parts of the southern end of the
Appalachians and probably evolved there, where the
cool, wet climate and diverse topography provide ideal
conditions for this group of animals. How many other
species of plants and animals evolved in the region and
subsequently spread far beyond this point of origin we
can only conjecture.</p>

of colors. The oaks&rsquo; acorn crop
is also important winter food for
several forest creatures. Chestnuts
once supplied winter food,
too, but a blight virtually eliminated
the chestnut trees earlier
this century, adding to the importance
of acorns.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<h3 id="c7">Bears, Boars and Acorns</h3>
<p>As frosts touch the earth and the reds and yellows of fall
creep down the mountainsides, oaks, hickories, beeches,
and other trees shed their fruits. Many animals will join
in the harvest of this fruit, but several, especially bear,
deer, wild boar, gray squirrel, chipmunk, turkey, and
ruffed grouse, are particularly dependent on this mast, as
it is called, for their autumn and winter welfare. With the
chestnut gone these animals must rely mostly on acorns.
Oaks, unlike the chestnut, do not produce consistently,
but fruit abundantly some years and fail in others. In the
poor years, when competition for mast is keen, the
effects are starvation, wandering, and mass migrations.
The appearance and multiplication of European wild
boars in the park have only added to the pressure on the
native animal species. Acorn shortages bring into sharp
focus the life styles and survival systems of the mast-dependent
animals. From among these the wild boar
emerges as an ecological villain, although we should
perhaps cast man, who introduced the boar here, in
that role.</p>
<p>The loss of the chestnut illustrates how a change in
one element can irrevocably alter an entire ecosystem.
As the chestnuts of the Smokies died, their place was
taken primarily by chestnut oak, northern red oak, red
maple, hemlock, and silverbell. The annual mast crop
suffered from this change in two ways. First, only about
half of the replacement trees were mast-bearing oaks.
Second, oaks are not dependable mast-bearers. Mast
failures seem to result mainly from spring freezes during
the pollinating and fertilization of oak flowers. Chestnuts
bloomed in the first two weeks of June when the danger
of frost was slight and so they bore well nearly every
year. This difference in flowering time has had reverberations
throughout the animal world within these mountains.
By looking into the life histories and population
dynamics of some of the acorn eaters we may get some
idea of the nature and extent of those reverberations.</p>
<p>Whitetail deer prefer young forests and mixtures of
forest and field because in these areas an abundance of
shrubs and herbaceous plants provides ample food. The
mature forests of the Smokies have relatively little forage
near the ground and so they support only small numbers
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
of deer. In the Cades Cove area, however, the lush
meadows and second-growth forest feed several hundred
deer. In the fall deer join in the mast harvest, but
they do not depend on it as do the bears, gray squirrels,
wild boars, and chipmunks. Deer have the option of
eating twigs, buds, and herbaceous plants. They eat
acorns, however, and this nutritious food will help them
enter winter in good condition. Deer mating takes place
from September to November in the Smokies, as the
mature males each run with a female for several days,
then hunt for another. In winter the bucks shed their
antlers and join the does and yearlings. In May or June
the does give birth to their spotted fawns, usually twins.
The summer bands you see in Cades Cove are again
separated by sex as the bucks once again grow antlers in
preparation for the autumn battles.</p>
<p>Now that wolves and other large predators are gone
from the Smokies, starvation and disease are the principal
checks on deer numbers. Late in 1971 a disease that
causes massive bleeding struck the herd in Cades Cove,
killing many of the deer and a few cattle. But by the
following spring an increase in the production of offspring
and the influx of deer from nearby areas brought
the herd back almost to its former number.</p>
<p>Gray squirrel numbers fluctuate even more dramatically,
as populations build up and then collapse, but
these oscillations occur even when food is adequate.
Until recently, some observers thought these oscillations
were amplified by mast failures, but apparently they are
not. In the Smokies, gray squirrels are found mostly in
the oak and beech forest of the lower and middle elevations,
while their smaller cousins, the red squirrels, stick
more to the upper elevations. In years of extreme low
population swings such as 1946 and 1968, many migrating
squirrels have been killed on the highways; others
have even been seen attempting to swim Fontana Lake.
The loss of gray squirrels in 1946 was estimated at 90
percent for some watersheds.</p>
<p>Turkeys and ruffed grouse both feed heavily on acorns
in the fall, although they, like the deer, have other possibilities.
Turkey and grouse also feed on the fruits of
dogwood and wild grape; beechnuts in good years; seeds;
and buds. A statewide study in Virginia found that acorns
supplied about one-quarter of the annual diet of wild
turkeys, and this proportion is much higher in fall. Acorns
are also a top food item in fall for ruffed grouse.</p>
<p>We come now to the two chief antagonists in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
annual mast hunt, bears and wild boars. The arrival of
wild boars in the park has meant added competition for
bears, as well as many other disruptive ecological effects.
By considering the population dynamics and seasonal
activities of these two species, we get a clear contrast
between their roles. One fits in with the forest &ldquo;establishment&rdquo;
and one clearly does not.</p>
<p>How many bears live in the park? This is difficult to
determine because bears are secretive and tend to wander.
The National Park Service estimates that numbers
usually range from about 400 up to about 600, depending
on reproduction, food availability, extent of poaching,
and other factors. The estimates are based on intensive
research by the University of Tennessee in the northwest
quarter of the park.</p>
<p>From about December to March black bears sleep,
although they occasionally come out for brief periods.
During the University of Tennessee studies it was learned,
to the surprise of many, that bears in the Great Smokies
had a preference for denning in hollow trees, sometimes
as much as 15 meters (50 feet) above the ground. Typically,
such a tree has been broken off by storms and
provides an entrance and some sort of platform within
that supports the bear. In such a den, or one in a protected
place on the ground, the female in alternate years gives
birth to tiny cubs weighing about a half-kilo (18 ounces)
apiece.</p>
<p>Most bears leave their dens in late March or April and
from then until early summer, when berries begin ripening,
they find food scarce. Black bears are primarily vegetarians,
though they eat almost any animal matter they can
find, from ants to large mammals, as well as carrion. In
spring they graze grasses heavily. Squawroot, a fleshy,
conelike, parasitic plant, is a favored food then, so much
so that local people call squawroot bear potato or bear
cabbage. Roots and insect grubs also help to see the
bears through spring, a time so lean for them that droppings
are seldom seen on the trails. At this season bears
roam widely at all elevations. Mating occurs in early
summer.</p>
<p>From late July until early September the bears concentrate
on berries, especially the blackberries growing
in open places such as ridgetops and balds, and the
blueberries most abundant in open oak-pine woods. Since
insects and vertebrate animals are most numerous in
summer, bears harvest them more frequently then than
at other times. They especially seek beetles and nests of
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
yellowjackets. With throngs of campers in the park bears
investigate this source of food, too. National Park Service
management practices are aimed at ending such
scavenging&mdash;which makes bears both dependent on and
dangerous to people&mdash;and ensuring that the animals live
out their normal lives in the forest. Being deprived of
garbage will work no hardship because, for bears and
most other animals, summer is the season of abundance.</p>
<p>As fall progresses blackberries, blueberries, and beetles
diminish in the diet and acorns and beechnuts increase
until they become the primary sustenance. Bears are
particularly fond of white oak acorns, the sweetest. In
their eagerness the huge animals, which sometimes reach
200 kilos (450 pounds) in weight, even climb trees and
crawl out on the branches as far as they can to eat the
fruits or break off and drop the branch tips for consumption
on the ground. They also relish black cherries and
serviceberries. A park naturalist told me of watching a
very large bear climb a 5-centimeter (2-inch) thick serviceberry
on Spence Field, bending the tree double.
Throughout the Southern Appalachians you can see
small serviceberries broken down like this by bears in
their quest for the fruits.</p>
<p>In most years the mast crop is adequate for all the
animals dependent on it, but in the years of failure bears
are hard pressed to find enough to eat. They wander
down out of the mountains in search of food. In such
years many are killed by hunters outside the national
park. The loss of bears in some of the poorest mast years
may be one-third to one-half of the park&rsquo;s bear population.</p>
<p>Enter now the European wild boar. Its history in the
Smokies is another classic example, along with the chestnut
blight fungus, balsam woolly aphid, Norway rat,
Starling, and a host of other pests, of the damage that can
be done by introducing an organism to territory outside
its normal range. The wild boars in the Smokies are
believed to be descendants of animals, purportedly of
stock from Germany, that escaped from a game preserve
on Hooper Bald, southwest of Fontana Lake, in the
early 1920s. They were first detected in the park about
1950. By the early 1960s wild boars, now with some
admixture of domestic pig blood, had spread east to
Newfound Gap and, in the lower country, to Cosby and
possibly Cataloochee. Their occupation of the entire
park seemed imminent.</p>
<p>So now the Smokies have a wild counterpart of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
domestic hog, the staple livestock animal that mountaineers
once ran year-round in these woods. Horace
Kephart&rsquo;s vivid description of the hog in the 1920s applies
almost as well to today&rsquo;s European wild boar: &ldquo;In physique
and mentality, the razorback differs even more from a
domestic hog than a wild goose does from a tame one,&rdquo;
Kephart wrote. &ldquo;Shaped in front like a thin wedge, he
can go through laurel thickets like a bear. Armored with
tough hide cushioned by bristles, he despises thorns,
brambles, and rattlesnakes, alike. His extravagantly long
snout can scent like a cat&rsquo;s, and yet burrow, uproot,
overturn, as if made of metal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hog&rsquo;s long legs, thin flanks, and pliant hoofs fitted
it to run like a deer and climb like a goat, Kephart
claimed, calling it &ldquo;a warrior born&rdquo; who was also a first
rate strategist.</p>
<p>The European wild boar sometimes attains a height of
nearly a meter (three feet) at the shoulder and a weight of
100 kilos (220 pounds). It is built rather like a bison, the
hindquarters sloping down from the shoulders. The long,
hairy-tipped tail and, in the male, well-developed tusks
also distinguish it from its domestic counterpart. Obviously,
this is a formidable animal, as numerous boar
hunters who have been treed by it or watched it cut up
their dogs can attest. Normally, however, wild boars are
not dangerous and run at the sight or scent of man. One
evening, standing in a yard where a boar had rooted the
night before, I asked a long-time boar observer about the
animal&rsquo;s pugnacity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t attack you unless they&rsquo;re wounded or
hemmed,&rdquo; this observer related. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried to get them to
charge me. Even picked up a squealing piglet once, but
the sow didn&rsquo;t attack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wild boars feed mostly at night. Campers near balds
in the western section of the park sometimes see them
or hear their grunts and snorts as they run away. The
females and young travel about in family groups but the
males are loners. Though the animals are elusive, spending
their days resting in dense cover, the signs of their
rooting are very obvious on balds, in beech gaps and
open fields, and along trails in moist woods.</p>
<p>Wild boars move seasonally in quest of food. In spring
they eat a lot of grass, as well as succulent roots and the
upper parts of wildflowers, which are especially abundant
in cove forests and high-elevation beech forests. In
summer they continue eating grass and other herbaceous
plants but also seek huckleberries, blueberries,
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
and blackberries. When acorns, hickory nuts, beechnuts,
and other tree fruits start falling, they turn their
attention to these, which in abundant years can carry the
boars through winter. When the mast fails they feed
heavily on tubers of wild yam and the outer layer of
pitch pine roots. Throughout the year they supplement
this vegetable diet with whatever invertebrates, salamanders,
snakes, rodents, and other small animals they can
root out or catch. Carrion and garbage are always welcome,
too. The wild boar, as classic an omnivore as his
domestic cousin, will eat almost anything.</p>
<p>Aside from the competition they give other masteaters
in the critical fall season, wild boars upset the ecological
balance in additional ways. Susan Bratton, research biologist
with the National Park Service&rsquo;s Uplands Field
Research Laboratory here in the Smokies, has made
detailed studies of boar damage. She found that in some
areas boars had greatly reduced the numbers of certain
wildflowers, such as spring-beauty, yellow adder&rsquo;s-tongue,
and wake-robin. Many other kinds of herbaceous wildflower
species in the park are known to have been eaten,
uprooted, or trampled. Wild boars also damage tree
roots and seedlings, but apparently avoid beeches, thus
favoring the root sprouting of this species. They root up
grass sod on balds, which speeds the invasion of balds by
other herbaceous plants and trees and they cause soil
erosion by removing the plant cover. They also harm
native species by preying on those mentioned above and
destroying the nests and eggs of ground-nesting birds
such as grouse and turkeys.</p>
<p>With such a list of black marks against the non-native
wild boar, it becomes readily apparent why the National
Park Service is concerned about its numbers in the park.
Conventional methods of trapping and directly reducing
the boar population have limited their impact in certain
areas of the park. Unfortunately, because of the
animal&rsquo;s tremendous reproductive capability the efforts
are not successful in reducing the total park population.
The technology to completely eradicate the boar from
the park is not available at the present time. Park Service
research is now aimed at control methods. Estimates of
the boar population have ranged upward to 2,000. But
no reliable method of counting the boar in the park has
yet been devised. University of Tennessee research has
indicated that there may be at least 1,000 boars in the
national park. Other estimates suggest there might be
twice that many. Wild boars can reproduce any month
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
of the year and most females bear a litter of from one
to twelve piglets each year. And the wild boar has few
enemies in the park, although bears and bobcats may
occasionally take the young boars. With such a high
reproductive potential, and so few controlling agents,
the wild boar population has reached a size that severely
alters and damages the park&rsquo;s natural environment.</p>
<p>Contrast these population dynamics with those of a
competing native species, the black bear: Bears reproduce
every other year, typically giving birth to only two
cubs. When the mast fails they may not reproduce at all,
apparently because the embryo does not implant, or is
resorbed, or the mother has insufficient milk to keep the
young alive. In some years, when bears wander out of the
national park, many are killed by hunters. Each year
poaching within the park takes several more. Hunting
aside, bear populations became attuned to the supportive
capacity of the environment through centuries of
adaptation. Wild boars have been here only a few decades,
far too short a time for the species to be integrated
into the total forest community.</p>
<p>As the wild boars multiply unchecked in the park, they
damage ground cover, inhibit tree reproduction, increase
erosion, and decrease the native animals with which they
compete for food. Perhaps hardest hit are black bears,
squirrels, and those other species that in the fall depend
on the all-important acorn.</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>The wild boar came to the Great
Smoky Mountains National Park
uninvited in the early 1920s.
While its population remained
small, the boar was not thought
a menace. Since the 1960s however,
it has become obvious that
the boar constitutes an ecological
disaster of great proportions.
In feeding, the animals move
together and root up the ground
or a stream bed with unbelievable
thoroughness.</p>
<p>After boars have tackled a stretch
of trout stream, it looks as
though a bulldozer had churned
it up. Presumably they seek
aquatic insects, salamanders,
and even a few small fish. Salamanders
are among the park&rsquo;s
chief biological treasures, so the
boars have not endeared themselves
to those who are responsible
for managing wildlife here
in the park.</p>
<p>Another biological prize in these
mountains is the grass bald habitat.
These energetic porkers
were not slow to find balds a food
source, ravenously digging for
June beetle larvae. The grass bald
survives only by the turf&rsquo;s resistance
to tree invasions, so the
boar and its plowing threatens
the existence of these unique,
and as yet incompletely understood,
grass balds that are both
prizes and puzzles.</p>
<p>Over the years it has been suggested
that diverse species are
directly threatened by the expanding
boar population. These
include ground-nesting birds,
yellow adder&rsquo;s-tongue and other
wildflowers, and possibly deer
and bear.</p>
<p>Studies are underway to determine
the extent of the boar&rsquo;s
damage, and hence the real
threat they pose. But we have no
good comparative figures on the
populations of other species
for the years before boars arrived.
Despite this lack, it has not been
difficult to brand the boar a
villain. But to control them has
not been so easy. In good years
they thrive&mdash;and gobble up
more park resources.</p>
<p>There is a food preference relationship
between turkeys, deer,
bear, and boars in their mutual
dependence on annual acorn
and hickory nut crops. The
widespread chestnut blight
wiped out this dependable
annual crop of nuts on which
bears, deer, turkeys, and other
animals fed in preparation for
winter before the boars arrived.
Now all these species compete&mdash;and
the prolific boar is a lusty
competitor&mdash;for a more uncertain
acorn/hickory crop.</p>
<p>Some would cast the boar as
pure villain. Others would say
that people are at fault for introducing
the boar into this region
as an exotic species. The sport
of hunting was anticipated with
relish but the consequences were
not considered at all. The boars
have now bred with domestic
pigs to such an extent that the
markings vary from animal to
animal. Some show definite
spots, others few or none at all.
Wildlife artist George Founds,
who drew the boars and bear
on these pages, was once a guide
in this region.</p>

<p>Many admire the bear above all
other park animals, associating
it intimately with wilderness
scenery. Not seeing a bear can
be a disappointment. But bears
are shy and secretive; about 95
percent never come near the
roads here. You might be surprised
that bears, classed as
carnivores, are about 80 percent
vegetarian. But they will eat
almost anything.</p>
<p>The sow will usually have two
cubs every two years. They are
born blind and hairless, no bigger
than a young rabbit. In two
months they will leave the den
under the watchful, if indulgent,
eye of a fiercely protective
mother who is a stern disciplinarian.
It is good training, for
bears live by stealth and cunning
as much as brute strength.
(Scientists think bears may be
almost as bright as primates.)
Bears feed in summer on berries.
In autumn they forage on hickory
nuts and acorns to build fat
reserves for the long winter
they spend in the den.</p>
<p>Bears are tree climbers (see
<a href="#fig111">note on denning</a> below), especially if
climbing brings food within
reach. Bears have been observed
bending small trees double.
Many they will break to get at
the fruit. They may climb out on
branches to get at fruit, or break
the branches off and consume
the fruit on the ground.</p>

<h3 id="c8">The Tracks of Our Predecessors</h3>
<p>Rocks rose out of the sea and became mountains.
Plants clothed them and animals lived among the plants,
all evolving and changing over the millions of years. A
few thousand years ago, a dense green mantle of giant
trees covered the Smokies. Bears roamed the forest and
bison followed their ages-old trails across the mountains.
Beavers built dams across lowland streams, and meadows
followed when the beavers moved on. Elk and deer
came out of the forest to feed in the meadows and
cougars and wolves hunted the elk and deer. It might
have gone on this way for even more thousands of years.</p>
<p>But then people came. First Indians, then settlers,
then the lumber companies. What was the impact of this
new element, this two-legged animal? How did the forest
and its life change? Is it now returning to its former state?
In trying to answer these questions we may learn something
about the ecological role of people not only in the
Smokies but also in much of eastern North America,
most of which resembled the Smokies in its forest cover
when people first arrived on the scene.</p>
<p>For at least several thousand years groups of humans
have lived in the lowlands around the Great Smokies.
Use of the highlands themselves by these earlier groups
was probably limited, however. Our history of peoples in
the mountains begins with reports of explorers who
visited the Cherokees in the late 17th and 18th centuries.
They found this tribe, which is thought to have left the
ancestral Iroquoian territory and moved southward about
the year 1000, dispersed in small villages along foothill
streams in a great arc around the Southern Appalachians.
Primarily an agricultural people, the Cherokees
tended fields of corn, squash, beans, melons, and tobacco
around their thatched log cabins. But they also hunted
and fished, and gathered wild plant materials for both
food and trade. Although the mountains harbored spirits
that were not entirely friendly, the Cherokees camped in
coves and gaps to hunt bear and deer, to gather nuts and
berries, and to gather stone for implements. Early reports
from the Smokies noted the large numbers of deer, bear,
and beaver skins being traded by the Cherokees. Quite
possibly, they set fire to attract game and promote the
growth of berry bushes, thus creating some of the mysterious
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
grass balds atop the Smokies. For purposes of trade
and warfare they established trails through the mountains.
Such a trail across Indian Gap remained the principal
cross-mountain route until early this century.</p>
<p>What effect did all this have on the tapestry of life in
the mountains? Undoubtedly the Cherokees increased
the area of open land, although some of their cropland
might have been established on old beaver meadows.
They may also have reduced the numbers of game and
fur animals, although 18th-century travelers in the region
still could be amazed at the abundance of deer, bison,
beaver, cougars, and other animals. No species except
the bison is known to have disappeared during the years
the Cherokees had sole dominion over the land, and they
may have contributed in some way to this one loss. With
relatively small numbers in the Smokies, and a lack of
highly destructive implements, especially guns, the Cherokees
apparently changed the ecological picture only
slightly in the days before contact with Europeans.</p>
<p>In the 1790s settlers, legally or illegally, began taking
over former Cherokee land in the Smokies, beginning
with two of the broader lowland valleys, the Oconaluftee
and Cades Cove. As the Cherokees yielded more and
more land, by treaty or to theft, settlement by the new
Americans proceeded up other valleys, until by 1826
almost every watershed was occupied by at least a few
families. Clearing and occupation of land continued
through the 19th century, the largest concentrations
developing in the Sugarlands (along the West Prong of
Little Pigeon River), Greenbrier Cove, and Cataloochee,
in addition to the earliest areas of settlement. In 1926,
when land buying for the newly authorized park began,
there were 1,200 farms and 7,300 people within the park
boundaries. By this time, however, farming in the Smokies
had passed its peak.</p>
<p>By contrast with earlier Indian inhabitants, the farmers
had considerable impact on the land. Most obvious
was the removal of forest to make homesites, cropland,
and pastures. By 1902, eight percent of the land on the
Tennessee side of the Smokies and seven percent on the
North Carolina side had been cleared. As settlement
proceeded up a hollow farmers were confronted with
steeper and steeper slopes. The inevitable results of
trying to raise corn on the sides of mountains were rapid
loss of fertility and then of the soil itself, as the heavy
rains leached out nutrients and washed away first the
humus and then the mineral soil beneath. In this wilderness
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
where virgin land was still abundant, many mountaineers
simply cleared a new patch when the old one
gave out. Horace Kephart, a midwesterner who lived
among such farmers on the North Carolina side early in
the 20th century, recorded their approach to cultivation.
They would clear land and get out two or three
crops of corn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When corn won&rsquo;t grow no more I can turn the field
into grass a couple of years,&rdquo; Kephart&rsquo;s informant says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll rotate, and grow corn again?&rdquo; Kephart
asks, a bit ingenuously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;La, no! By that time the land will be so poor hit
wouldn&rsquo;t raise a cuss-fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then you must move, and begin all over again.&rdquo;
Kephart counters. &ldquo;This continual moving must be a
great nuisance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kephart overstates the case, however, because most
stayed in one house for two to three generations, or
about 50 to 75 years.</p>
<p>Clearing and the erosion that sometimes followed
were relatively local and distinct effects of settlement.
Uses of uncleared forest land had widespread, but more
subtle, effects. Selected white pines and yellow-poplars
were cut for lumber; oaks for shingles; and hickories
mostly for firewood. Other species were put to less
important, miscellaneous uses. Many plants were collected
for food and dyes or for medicinal purposes.
Ginseng, which has a forked root highly prized in China
for its supposed medicinal and aphrodisiac values, was
nearly eliminated by eager &ldquo;sang&rdquo; diggers who sold the
roots for export. Probably even more pervasive was the
influence of livestock. Hogs, and sometimes cattle and
sheep, were allowed to roam the forests, grazing, browsing,
and rooting for a living. Mast&mdash;acorns, chestnuts,
and beechnuts&mdash;formed an important part of the diet of
hogs, but these omnivorous creatures ate all sorts of
plants and small animals. As anyone knows who has
observed a grazed woodlot, livestock can quickly impoverish
the ground and shrub layers of a forest. Grazing
and browsing, along with use of fire, prevented the
return of forest to the grass balds. All these uses of the
forest undoubtedly changed the proportions of many
tree and lesser plant species in the total forest composition.
Precisely how much they did so cannot now be
determined.</p>
<p>The impact of settlement on certain wildlife species is
more easily seen. Elk disappeared about the time the
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
earliest pioneers moved in. The beaver, an easily trapped
animal, was nearly gone by the end of the 19th century.
Wolves and cougars, hunted because they sometimes
killed livestock&mdash;and uncomfortable in the presence of
people&mdash;followed soon after. Deer, bear, and turkey
persisted but in much-reduced numbers, with the bears
retreating to rough, wild country in the central heights.
Smaller animals fared better, although such hunted species
as raccoon, opossum, and gray squirrel perhaps
suffered some reduction.</p>
<p>About 1900 a new era began, bringing the greatest
shock yet to Great Smokies ecosystems. Large lumber
companies, having logged off the big timber of New
England and the Great lakes states, turned their attention
to the virgin stands of the Southern Appalachians.
Setting up sawmills at the fringes of the mountains, they
rapidly worked their way up the coves, just as Cherokees
and settlers had done before them. Railroads, built to
carry logs to the mills, were extended upstream as cutting
progressed. In some watersheds, such as those of the
Little River, Big Creek, and the Oconaluftee, nearly all
species of trees were taken. In others, such as Abrams
Creek, West Prong of the Little Pigeon, and Cataloochee,
cutting was selective. By the late 1920s, logging, added to
settlement practices, had at least partially cleared more
than 60 percent of the land in the Great Smoky Mountains.</p>
<p>Though for a time it proved an economic boon, logging
was easily the most destructive form of land use the
region was ever subjected to. The removal of forest
cover and the skidding of logs down steep mountainsides
caused widespread erosion. This weakened the foundation
for regrowth and clogged streams with sediment,
thereby reducing their quality for sustaining aquatic life.
In the wake of logging came forest fires, probably the
worst these mountains have seen. Heaps of dried branches
trimmed from logs made perfect tinder for fires started
by engine sparks, careless matches, or lightning strikes.
In the 1920s disastrous fires roared up the East Prong of
Little River, up Forney Creek to Clingmans Dome, and
over the slopes around Charlies Bunion. Scars from
some of these fires have still not healed today.</p>
<p>What was the net biological effect of the presence of
people in the mountains in 1926, the year Congress
authorized Great Smoky Mountains National Park?
Broadly speaking, the forest and its animals had been
diminished but the plants and animals of grassland and
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
brush had increased. The gray wolf was gone but the
meadowlark had arrived. In 1930 the American people
inherited lands that were still about 40 percent virgin
forest, the largest such chunk of forest left in the East.
The rest of the park was a patchwork of uncut forest,
young second growth, and openings dotted with houses
and barns and fringed with stone walls and fences. The
park therefore preserved much of the primeval splendor
of the Smokies, but the activities of people would long
remain visible in it, and some of these would deliberately
be maintained as part of the region&rsquo;s historical heritage.</p>
<p>Today most of the former fields, except those such as
Cades Cove that are purposely kept open, have returned
to forest. But it is still easy to recognize these grown-over
fields by the types of trees on them. Many bear a nearly
solid stand of straight-stemmed yellow-poplars. Others
are marked by a dense growth of pines. Dr. Randolph
Shields, who grew up in Cades Cove and became chairman
of the biology department at nearby Maryville College,
has watched the plant succession on old fields in the
Cove since about 1930. He has found there that pines
usually are the first trees to spring up among the grasses,
herbs, and blackberries and other shrubs that follow field
abandonment. On moist ground, yellow-poplars usually
come up under the pines, but sometimes hemlock and
white pine form a second tree stage under the pioneering
Virginia or pitch pines. Where yellow-poplars come
in, they usually shade out the light-loving pines in about
40 years. Gradually the many species of the cove forest
become established under the yellow-poplars, presaging
the mixed stand of big trees that will complete the cycle
initiated by clearing the land. On the drier slopes it may
take about 100 years for the pines to be shaded out by the
red maples, oaks, and hickories that eventually become
dominant in such areas.</p>
<p>As you might expect, animal life changes with the
progression of plant succession. Meadowlarks, bobwhites,
woodchucks, and cottontails are replaced by red-eyed
vireos, wood thrushes, chipmunks, and white-footed mice
as grassland and shrubs give way to forest. With age and
woodpecker activity, tree cavities develop in the forest,
providing homes for an additional complement of animals
such as screech owls, flying squirrels, raccoons,
bears, and opossums.</p>
<p>Under the protection accorded by its designation as a
national park several animals have made a dramatic
comeback in the Smokies. Bears once again roam the
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
entire mountain area. Turkeys are frequently seen in
such places as Cades Cove, where openings break the
mantle of forest. In recent years sporadic beaver activity
has been noted in the park. Even cougars are occasionally
reported, although their presence has not been
conclusively established. But wolves, elk, and bison&mdash;animals
that symbolize the Indian&rsquo;s America&mdash;probably
cannot be brought back.</p>
<p>Nature again reigns supreme in the Smokies. We may
never see here the numbers of wildlife that surprised the
first explorers, but we can see remnants of the giant-treed
forests that greeted them, and we can marvel at the
undulating expanse of green, a beautiful suggestion of
the vast hardwood forest that once cloaked eastern
America.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What kind of people were the
Smokies pioneers? Part of the
answer awaits you at the Pioneer
Farmstead next to the Oconaluftee
Visitor Center on the
North Carolina side of the park.
The farmstead buildings suggest
an independent people who were
hardworking, laboring spring,
summer, and fall to prepare for
the coming winter.</p>
<p>This is a typical Southern Appalachian
pioneer farm. The life
style of earlier years is demonstrated
by people in period dress
here from May through October.
A few animals roam the farm-yard
and the garden produces
traditional crops. In the fall
sorghum cane may be pressed to
make sorghum molasses. Inside
the cabin&mdash;you can poke your
head through its open doors and
windows&mdash;traditional breads
may be baking, or a quilt be
patching, or wool a-spinning.
And don&rsquo;t forget to notice the
fieldstone chimneys, the squared
logs&rsquo; careful notchings, and the
handsplit wooden &ldquo;shakes&rdquo; up
on the roof.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i048b.jpg" alt="Field work" width="604" height="441" />
</div>
<p>Just up the road is Mingus Mill,
an excellent example of a
turbine-powered gristmill. A
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
miller is often on hand May
through October to answer your
questions about how waterpower
was used to produce cornmeal
and flour. You might even be
able to purchase some of the
cornmeal or the flour ground
right at the mill. Wheat is harder
than corn and requires harder
stone to grind it. Millstones for
grinding wheat in this area were
imported from France. The
stones used for grinding corn
were cut domestically.</p>

<p>A commercial mill the size of
Mingus Mill would generally be
built by a specially skilled carpenter
known as a millwright, a
term which has taken broader
meaning today.</p>

<p class="pcap">Cades Cove</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Cades Cove preserves the image
of the early settlers&rsquo; self-sufficient
life style in the Smokies. It was
not all romance. Cades Cove
itself is expansive, level, idyllic
farmland, which hardly describes
most of the Smokies.
Cades Cove is today an open
air museum. Here are the beautifully
restored and picturesque
Elijah Oliver cabin; the still-operated
Cable Mill grinding
flour with water power; and
numerous churches, houses, and
cabins. At Cable Mill are many
artifacts of past agricultural
practices from throughout the
Smokies. The largely self-sufficient
agricultural economy
here came to an end with the
advent of logging about 1900.</p>

<img src="images/i049b.jpg" alt="Church building and graveyard" width="608" height="444" />
</div>
<p>By 1920, most Smokies residents
were linked to a cash economy,
to manufactured items and
store-bought foods. But Cades
Cove preserves glimpses of the
pioneer ingenuity that wrested
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
a living from the landscape.
Preserved with the cabins here
are many ingenious devices such
as effective door latches simply
fashioned from local wood.</p>
<p>In 1850 Cades Cove supported
685 people in 132 families. Most
originally came from Virginia via
routes followed today by Interstate
81 and U.S. 411. A treaty
in 1819 transferred the Cades
Cove from Cherokee to State of
Tennessee ownership. Settlers
traded in what is now Townsend,
and in Maryville and Knoxville.</p>
<p>A delightful 18-kilometer (11-mile)
one-way loop road unfolds
the quiet pleasures of Cades
Cove to you. This is a popular
route with bikers because it is so
scenic&mdash;and not so arduous. Periodically
the loop road is closed
to motor vehicles for the sake of
bicyclists. Early farmers were
quick to appreciate the same
level aspect of the cove that
appeals to today&rsquo;s cyclist.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Cherokee nation was settled
in the shadow of the Smokies.
&ldquo;The place of the blue smoke,&rdquo;
they called the mountains in their
heartland, and so the Smokies
have become named. Myth, ritual,
and religion bound the Cherokees
closely to the land. Ironically,
they enjoyed a sophisticated
culture very similar to the
white culture that would so cruelly
supplant them. They were agrarian
and democratic, and they
believed in one god. They lived
in mud-and-log cabins, women
sharing tribal governance, and
men sharing household duties.</p>
<div class="img">

</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i050c.jpg" alt="Basketmaking" width="588" height="431" />
</div>
<p>The Cherokees rapidly adopted
governmental features of the
invading culture. They adopted
a written legal code in 1808.
Within a dozen years they had
divided their nation into judicial
districts with designated judges.
Two years later they had established
the Supreme Court of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
feat. Within just two years of
its adoption, <i>The Cherokee
Phoenix</i> newspaper was published
and most Cherokee-speakers
could read and write!
But the white people had an insatiable
appetite for land. Treaty
after treaty was made and broken.
The fatal blow was the discovery
of gold in 1828 near the Cherokee
villages in northern Georgia.
Within a few years all their land
was confiscated. The infamous
&ldquo;Trail of Tears&rdquo; came with
passage of the 1830 Removal Act.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i050d.jpg" alt="Woman" width="605" height="434" />
</div>
<p>Some 13,000 Cherokees were
forced to march to Oklahoma:
25 percent died en route. Not
all left, however, and some soon
returned. Today the eastern
band of Cherokees lives on the
Cherokee Reservation on the
park&rsquo;s North Carolina side.</p>

<h4 class="interlude" id="c11"> Going to the Great Smokies</h4>
<p>The Great Smoky Mountains National
Park straddles the North Carolina-Tennessee
boundary for about 110 kilometers
(70 miles). It is accessible by car from the
Interstate highways encircling it as they
connect the Tennessee cities of Knoxville
and Chattanooga with Asheville, North
Carolina; Greenville, South Carolina; and
Atlanta, Georgia. The Blue Ridge Parkway
reaches its southern terminus here
on the park&rsquo;s North Carolina side. Major
gateways to the park are Cherokee and
Bryson City, North Carolina, and the cities
of Pigeon Forge, Gatlinburg, Townsend,
and Cosby, in Tennessee. These urban
areas with their tourist services are connected
by Newfound Gap Road (U.S. 441),
the only park road that crosses the mountains.
It is closed to commercial vehicles.</p>
<p>The National Park Service, U.S. Department
of the Interior, is responsible for the
management of the park. The superintendent&rsquo;s
address is Gatlinburg, Tennessee
37738. Telephone (615) 436-5615. Park
headquarters is located 3.2 kilometers (2
miles) south of Gatlinburg, on the Newfound
Gap Road.</p>
<p>Maps, guides, and information on
routes, points of interest, accommodations,
and services are available from
several sources. For a Tennessee highway
map write to the Department of
Transportation, Nashville, Tennessee
37243-0349, or telephone (615) 741-2331.
For Tennessee vacation information
write to Department of Tourist Development,
P.O. Box 23170, Nashville, Tennessee
37202, or telephone (615)

<p>For a North Carolina highway
map write to Travel and Tourism
Division, 430 No. Salisbury, Raleigh,
North Carolina 27603, or telephone
(919) 733-4171.
The division distributes several brochures
on North Carolina vacations, recreation,
and special events; specify your interest
in the Smokies. The <i>North Carolina Outdoors</i>
booklet lists areas and facilities,
including private campgrounds, keyed to
the official highway map.</p>

<p>Lodging and supplies
are available in Pigeon Forge,
Gatlinburg, Sevierville, Townsend,
Maryville, Bryson City, Cherokee, and
other Tennessee and North Carolina
towns surrounding the park. No public
transportation serves the national
park. Major airlines serve Knoxville,
Tennessee and Asheville, North Carolina,
where cars may be rented.</p>
<h4 id="c13">Visitor Centers</h4>
<p>National Park Service Visitor Centers are
located just inside the park on both the
North Carolina and Tennessee sides. On
the Tennessee side the Sugarlands Visitor
Center is 3.2 kilometers (2 miles) south of
Gatlinburg. The Cades Cove Visitor Center
(closed in winter) is located in the
Cable Mill area of the Cades Cove Loop
Road. On the North Carolina side the
Oconaluftee Visitor Center is 3.2 kilometers
(2 miles) north of Cherokee.</p>
<p>If you plan to be in the park just a few
hours or up to several days, you will do
yourself a favor by checking out a visitor
center. Museum displays give you a quick
and interesting insight into both nature
and history in the park. At Sugarlands
there is a free movie. Books, maps, and
other publications are offered for sale in
the visitor centers and free park folders
are available. These resources&mdash;and the
people working the information desks&mdash;can
help you plan your stay in the park within
the time limits you must meet.</p>
<p>The Great Smokies is a large park whose
diverse features are separated by significant
driving times. Park employees can
help you use your time to best advantage.</p>
<p>Visitor centers also offer restroom facilities,
drinking water, and a mail drop and
they sell film for your convenience. Here
you can get backpacking information and
apply for a backcountry use permit. (See
section on <a href="#ccc8">Backcountry Use</a>.) Visitor center
bulletin boards carry information on
road conditions, urgent contact requests,
and interpretive programs.</p>
<p>Visitor centers are open 8 a.m. to 4:30
p.m. during the winter, with extended
hours of operation in the spring, summer,
and fall. The Cades Cove Visitor
Center is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
from mid-April to late November.</p>
<h4 id="ccc1">Interpretive Programs</h4>
<p>Guided walks and evening programs are
conducted by the National Park Service
throughout the park. Most of these start
or take place at the visitor centers and at
campground amphitheaters. The uniformed
park employees who render these
services are trained in the natural history
and/or history of the Great Smokies. They
give you excellent vignettes of the park&rsquo;s
nature and its historical period of Indian
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
and mountaineer life and the opportunity
to ask questions. You, for instance, might
enjoy a short nature walk up a burbling
Smokies stream and so learn about the
more than 1,100 kilometers (700 miles) of
streams in the park. Schedules of these
activities and programs are posted at the
visitor centers and on campground bulletin
boards. A copy of the schedule is in
<i>Guide to Great Smoky Mountains National
Park</i>, which is available free at any visitor
center, ranger station, or campground.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig140">

</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i054a.jpg" alt="Oconaluftee Visitor Center" width="500" height="488" />
</div>
<p>Live demonstrations of mountain life skills
and folkways are also provided periodically
(spring through October) at places
such as the Pioneer Farmstead beside the
Oconaluftee Visitor Center and the nearby
Mingus Mill, or at the Cable Mill in Cades
Cove. You even might be able to buy
cornmeal freshly ground just as it was a
century or more ago.</p>
<p>Self-guiding nature trails have been laid
out throughout the park. Look for these
marked trails near campgrounds, visitor
centers, and picnic areas. Most are easy
walks of 1.5 kilometers (a mile) or less
which take you through former farmsteads
now returning to forest, groves of the
world-famous cove hardwoods, reclaimed
logged-over lands, or other aspects of the
park. Trails are well marked and seldom
difficult. At the trail&rsquo;s start look for a
container offering a descriptive brochure
for sale on the honor system.</p>
<p>Two self-guiding motor nature trails lead
you through impressive areas of the park
in the comfort and convenience of your
own vehicle. Near Gatlinburg, off the Cherokee
Orchard Road, is the Roaring Fork
Motor Nature Trail. Its scenic route takes
you by several restored pioneer buildings.
The Cades Cove Loop Road is an 18-kilometer
(11-mile) drive through the pleasant
scenery of Cades Cove. Here you get
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">106</span>
pleasant vistas out across the cove where
you may well see deer grazing against a
mountain backdrop. The fields recall the
rural scene of many years ago. A brochure
available at the start of the loop
describes points along the way that are
designated by numbered signs. At several
points you can park your car and visit
preserved farm structures, both log and
frame, and churches and cemeteries. Partway
through the loop is a small visitor
center and the restored Cable Mill. Associated
restored buildings here display farm
implements once used for valley and mountain
farming in this region.</p>
<p>Guided interpretive programs are offered
largely in summer. Check the current
schedule at the visitor centers or on campground
bulletin boards.</p>
<p>Evening campground programs offer interesting
free family entertainment. Try the
many interpretive programs offered at park
campgrounds in the evenings throughout
the week. Check bulletin boards for the
schedules.</p>
<p>The three most often asked questions in
the park are: Where can I fish? Where
can I camp? and What about the bears?
Some evening programs cover the bears
in detail and you will learn about unusual
denning habits in the Smokies. All evening
programs are offered for the general
public by trained National Park Service
interpreters. You will enjoy them no matter
how much, or how little, you know
about the topic. And you are free to ask
questions, knowing they will be taken seriously.</p>
<p>Evening programs cover such topics as
the pioneer life, wildlife, hiking, and the
incredible botanical story of the Smokies.
There are programs on the &ldquo;preserve and
protect&rdquo; philosophy of how the park is
managed, and exploring the park. For the
adventurous there are &ldquo;night prowls,&rdquo;
guided experiences after dark to sample
the sights, sounds, and odors of the night
forest.</p>
<p>Quiet walkways provide short walks on
easy grades. They usually begin at parking
areas that accommodate no more than
two cars, so crowds are excluded. This is
a nice way to experience the naturalness
of the Smokies in walks not exceeding 0.5
kilometers (0.3 miles).</p>

<p>A few comments may save time and open
new vistas for your driving in the Smokies.
Within just an hour&rsquo;s drive of each other
here are climatic differences created by
elevation. You can drive through the
spruce-fir forests typical of Maine up near
Clingmans Dome in late morning and be
driving through lush southern hardwoods
back near Sugarlands or Oconaluftee in
early afternoon.</p>
<p>The roads are designed for scenic driving.
There are numerous turnouts and parking
areas at viewpoints or historic sites.</p>
<p>Traffic, winding roads, and the scenery
conspire to making driving time more
important than distance here in the park.
Figure about twice the time to drive a
given distance that you would for normal
highways. Be on the alert for unexpected
driving behavior from others&mdash;they may
be under the influence of the scenery!
Gasoline is not sold in the park, so check
your gauge. Remember that winter storms
may close the Newfound Gap and Little
River Roads.</p>
<p>The main road in the park is the Newfound
Gap Road (U.S. 441) between
Gatlinburg and Cherokee. It is the only
road across the mountains. Along it and
at the Newfound Gap Parking Area you
will get some of the best scenic high-mountain
vistas in the park&mdash;and on the
East Coast, for that matter. If you want to
go still higher you can drive up the Clingmans
Dome Road from Newfound Gap
and walk up to the observation tower.
Here you are at the highest point in the
national park, and the third highest east
of the Rockies. The reward is a 360-degree
panorama of the sea of peaks for which
the Smokies (and Natahalas and Unakas
and ...) are famous. Clingmans Dome
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
Road is a deadend spur off the Newfound
Gap Road at the crest of the Smokies.</p>
<p>If you want to sample the Blue Ridge
Parkway and also enjoy some beautiful
mountain scenery from right up in it, try
the Balsam Mountain Road, which leaves
the parkway between Oconaluftee and
Soco Gap. It winds for 14.5 kilometers (9
miles) back into the national park&rsquo;s Balsam
Mountain Campground. Incredible
azalea displays will dazzle you here in
season. If you are adventurous and want
to try a mountain dirt road, continue past
the campground to the Heintooga Picnic
Area and the start of the Round Bottom
Road (closed during winter). This is a
22.5-kilometer (14-mile), partially one-way,
unpaved road that descends the mountain
to the river valley below and joins the
Big Cove Road in the Cherokee Indian
Reservation. You come out right below
Oconaluftee at the edge of the park.</p>
<p>Another view of the Smokies awaits you
along the Little River Road leading from
Sugarlands to Cades Cove. The road lies
on the old logging railroad bed for a distance
along the Little River. (The curves
suggest these were not fast trains!) Spur
roads lead off to Elkmont and Tremont
deeper in the park, and to Townsend and
Wear Cove, towns outside the park. Little
River Road becomes the Laurel Creek
Road and takes you on into Cades Cove
where you can take the one-way 18-kilometer
(11-mile) loop drive and observe
the historic mountain setting of early settlers.
If you are returning to Gatlinburg or
Pigeon Forge from Cades Cove, try exiting
the park toward Townsend and driving
the beautiful Wear Cove Road back to
U.S. 441 at the north end of Pigeon Forge.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most bucolic scenes in the
Smokies are to be seen from the Foothills
Parkway between Interstate 40 and Route
32 near Cosby, around the northeast tip
of the park. Here you look out across
beautiful farmland with the whole mass of
the Smokies rising as its backdrop.</p>
<p>Other interesting drives in the park are
the Rich Mountain Road, Parsons Branch
Road (both closed in winter), and the
Roaring Fork Motor Nature Trail. At the
west end of the park there is another
section of the Foothills Parkway between
Chilhowee and Walland. The parkway is
administered by the National Park Service.
A small leaflet, &ldquo;Auto Touring,&rdquo; is
available for a small charge at any of the
three visitor centers.</p>
<h4 id="ccc2">Mountain People and Folkways</h4>
<p>Right beside the Oconaluftee Visitor Center
as you enter the North Carolina side of
the park is the Pioneer Farmstead, a
restored small farm along the Oconaluftee
River. As you leave the visitor center
headed toward the mountains, Mingus
Mill Parking Area soon appears on your
left. The turbine-powered gristmill used
water power to grind cornmeal and flour.
Its millrace leaves a lively creek and spills
toward the mill under arching mountain-laurel.
Stones used to grind wheat came
from France. Cornmeal stones were of
local origin. Mingus Mill is open from
May through October and a miller is usually
on hand to answer your questions.</p>
<p>On the North Carolina side of the park
limited restored structures are also found
at Cataloochee.</p>
<p>The Cable Mill area in Cades Cove presents
the largest group of restored structures
on the Tennessee side of the park.
Farming is still permitted in Cades Cove
itself to preserve the open fields of the
rural scene there. The 18-kilometer (11-mile)
loop drive through Cades Cove takes
you by numerous log and frame structures.
The Elijah Oliver place is a particularly
beautiful log structure with outbuildings
in a cozy, shaded setting. The
stream flowing through Elijah Oliver&rsquo;s
springhouse once kept his milk supply
cool.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>Other pioneer structures include the
Little Greenbrier School off Little River
Road and cabins and houses along the
Roaring Fork Motor Nature Trail. Close
scrutiny of the many log structures
shows subtle variations in notching and
other details.</p>
<p>Living history demonstrations are offered
in season at Cades Cove, Mingus

the visitor center and campground bulletin
boards for schedules. These may
include craft demonstrations and concerts
of traditional mountain music. A
&ldquo;Mountain People&rdquo; leaflet is available
for a small charge at any of the park&rsquo;s
visitor centers.</p>
<h4 class="interlude" id="c15"> Wildflowers and Fall Colors</h4>
<p>With abundant warm sunshine and frequent
rainfall it is no surprise that about
200 species of showy wildflowers bloom
in the Smokies. They begin in March and
last until about November. Spring comes
to mind when most of us think about
flowers, but practically the whole year
has something to offer. Spring seems to
burst with flowers as they take advantage
of good conditions for a short period
between the cold of winter and the shade
of summer, when full foliage blocks sunlight
from the forest floor.</p>
<p>Bloom dates depend on the weather and
can vary from year to year. Here are
recommended dates to guide you: Dogwood
and redbud, mid- to late-April; spring
flowers, late March to mid-May; mountain-laurel
and flame azalea, May and June;
Catawba rhododendron, mid-June; and
rosebay rhododendron, June and July.</p>
<p>Springtime flowers are trilliums, phacelia,
violets, lady&rsquo;s-slippers, jack-in-the-pulpits,
and showy orchis. There are familiar exotic
(non-native) species too, such as the dandelion.
(In the Smokies exotics are generally
flowers of field and not of forest.)
Goldenrod, ironweed, and asters bloom
in late September to early October.</p>
<p>In August you may see wild clematis,
yellow-fringed orchis, bee-balm, cardinal-flower,
monkshood, and blue gentian.</p>
<p>Many flowers grow along park roadsides.
Other good locations to see them are along
quiet walkways and on designated nature
trails throughout the park. See photographs
of flowering shrubs and wildflowers
on pages <a class="pgref" href="#Page_58">58</a>-61.</p>
<p>Fall colors generally peak between October
15 and 25. The presence of hardwood
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
species usually associated with more northerly
climes makes the autumn leaves here
the more spectacular. Up and down the
mountain the brilliant reds of maples, the
golden yellow of beech, and the deeper
hues of oaks and more southerly species
blend spectacularly. Fall color is the result
of the breakdown of green chlorophyll in
deciduous leaves. Yellow and brown pigments
present all summer now become
prominent. Red colors are produced when
sugars are trapped in the sap of the leaves.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig144">
<img src="images/i057.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="492" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Spring and fall bursts of color are
annual drawing cards in the

</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i057a.jpg" alt="Dogwood in bloom" width="500" height="495" />
</div>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t mind chilly nights this can be
great camping weather, and a generally
pleasant time of year here. Keep in mind
that the traffic is particularly heavy in the
park during the fall foliage season, especially
on weekends.</p>
<p>A leaflet &ldquo;Forests and Wildflowers&rdquo; is available
from any park visitor center for a
small charge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<h4 class="interlude" id="c16"> Activities</h4>
<h4 id="ccc3">Horseback Riding</h4>
<p>The park has many kilometers of horse
trails and this is considered some of the
finest riding country in the East. If you
have your own horses and want to use
them in the Smokies, write to the superintendent
and request the &ldquo;Great Smoky
Mountains Trail Map&rdquo; folder and other
current information on horse use in the
park. The folder provides basic information
on sites and regulations and indicates
horse trails. The regulations are designed
to minimize the environmental impact of
stock.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t own a horse, don&rsquo;t worry.
You can rent one from a concessioner by
the hour, half day, day, or overnight at
five locations in the park: Cades Cove,
Cosby, Dudley Creek, Smokemont, and
Sugarlands. The National Park Service
requires the concessioner to send a guide
with all horse parties; this service is included
in the basic rental rate. For overnight trips
you must bring your own food. Saddlebags
and shelter are provided.</p>
<p>If you want to experience a more traditional
&ldquo;outfitted&rdquo; horseback trip, write to
area chambers of commerce for names of
commercial outfitters.</p>
<h4 id="ccc4">Bicycling</h4>
<p>The best place to bike in the Smokies is
Cades Cove. If you don&rsquo;t arrive on your
own bike or carry it on your car, you can
rent one from the concessioner there,
except in winter. The 18-kilometer (11-mile)
loop road is a paved, generally level-to-rolling
one-way country road around the
cove. It takes you by restored pioneer and
settlers&rsquo; structures, both log and frame.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig145">
<img src="images/i058.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="490" />
<p class="pcap">Fishing Smokies streams and
rivers and the nearby TVA lakes
is a popular pastime. Most
sought after in the park are rainbow
and brown trout.</p>
</div>
<div class="img" id="fig146">
<img src="images/i058a.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="489" />
<p class="pcap">Pictured
here is the brook trout. Please
take a good look because possession
of any brook trout is prohibited
in the park.</p>
</div>
<p>Along the way are many pleasant streams,
hiking trail access points, wooded stretches,
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
and the Cable Mill area with a small visitor
center. The scenery is nothing if not
glorious. You look out across the rolling,
open meadow to the mountains. And you
may see herds of deer grazing. In summer
bikers have the loop road to themselves&mdash;no
cars allowed&mdash;on Saturday mornings
until 10 a.m.</p>
<p>Biking conditions elsewhere in the park
are not generally good. The Newfound
Gap Road is steep, winding, crushingly
long, and can be full of traffic. Other park
roads tend to be winding and narrow as
well.</p>
<p>The Cades Cove bicycle concession is
located at the campground.</p>
<h4 id="ccc5">Fishing</h4>
<p>The Smokies offer a chance to fish in
rushing mountain streams and rivers. Of
the 70 or so kinds of fish in the park, those
that can be fished for are smallmouth
bass, rock bass, and rainbow and brown
trout. The native brook trout is protected
and its waters are closed to fishing. Rainbows
and brown trout are non-native species
and are managed to provide sustained-yield
fishing.</p>
<p>With a valid Tennessee or North Carolina
license you may fish open park
waters from sunrise to sunset. A license
is required for all persons 13 years of
age and older in Tennessee and 16 years
of age and older in North Carolina. Buy
licenses in nearby towns. Fishing with
bait is prohibited. Only single-hook artificial
lures may be used. Possession and
size limits may vary with stream and
species of fish, so check before you fish.
In general, <i>the possession of any brook
trout is prohibited</i>. The National Park
Service hopes to restore some native
brook trout waters encroached upon by
introduced brown and rainbow trout.</p>
<p>Local regulations are posted on streams
and can be obtained at any park ranger
station or visitor center. Or write to the
park superintendent in advance of your
trip.</p>
<h4 id="ccc6">Birding the Smokies</h4>
<p>The variety of birds here is striking. A
one-day count throughout the park and
vicinity in winter will net more than 50
species even in a bad year. More than 20
warblers are considered to breed within
the park, and nearly 30 members of the
finch family have been reported here. Geese
and ducks number nearly 20 species, but
are not often seen. Craggy mountain heights
provide ideal habitat for ravens, some
hawks, and occasional migrating peregrine
falcons. Eagles and falcons are only occasionally,
or rarely, seen, but the mere possibility
is exciting. If you are interested in
finding a particular bird or good birding
places, check at a visitor center. Some
birds are only seasonal residents or visitors
of the park.</p>
<p>Serious birders will want to see a copy
of the bird checklist. Free copies are
available at visitor centers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<h4 class="interlude" id="c17"> Hiking and Backpacking</h4>
<h4 id="ccc7">A Hiker&rsquo;s Paradise</h4>
<p>The fact that the National Park Service
maintains 1,450 kilometers (900 miles) of
trails says something about the Smokies
and hiking: it&rsquo;s an East Coast hiker&rsquo;s paradise.
Trails come in all lengths and levels
of difficulty, for the handicapped, children,
super-athletes, old folks, day hikers,
and long-distance backpackers. The latter
of course means the Appalachian Trail,
which threads the Smokies crest on its
way from Maine to Georgia. More on the
AT below.</p>
<p>The intimacy of the Smokies wilderness
surprises many who are attracted by the
stunning mountain scenery. This intimacy,
best seen afoot, is all but missed from
your vehicle. So is the mood set by wildflowers,
cascading streams, birdsong, and
the fragrance of fir trees so startling in the
Southeast. Hiking trails give access to
waterfalls such as Juneywhank, Abrams,
Hen Wallow, and Ramsay Cascades. A
leaflet, &ldquo;Streams and Waterfalls,&rdquo; is available
at visitor centers for a small charge.</p>
<p>On sale at visitor centers you will find
copies of the National Park Service&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Great Smoky Mountains Trail Map&rdquo;
folder. It has up-to-date information and
a shaded relief map of trails and popular
trailheads in the park. Detailed trail
descriptions are found in the Sierra Club
Totebook, <i>Hiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Smokies</i>,
sold at visitor centers and in area
book and outdoor equipment stores.</p>

</div>
<div class="img">

</div>
<p>You will want to wear comfortable, non-slip
shoes whether you go out for a half-hour
or a day. And you must expect variable
weather, characteristic of the Smokies.
Abundant rainfall can materialize quickly
on a day which began so clear just hours
ago. A light poncho or other rain gear is
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
handy. Make sure you will be warm enough,
too. (See &ldquo;<a href="#ccc13">Hypothermia and Winter Warnings</a>.&rdquo;) Days that are warm
at Sugarlands or Oconaluftee can be very
cold if rain and wind catch you at higher
elevations.</p>

<p>Attractions shift with the seasons in the
Smokies. The best way to meld your own
interests with current attractions for a pleasant
hike is to seek advice at a visitor
center. Describing your interests and asking
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s best to see this time of year?&rdquo;
may well produce custom-tailored hiking
advice. You will notice hikes are described
in time as well as distance because steeper
trails make simple distance a deceptive
measure. A leaflet, &ldquo;Walks and Hikes,&rdquo;
describes over 50 popular day hikes and is
available from park visitor centers for a
small charge.</p>
<h4 id="ccc8">Backcountry Use Permits</h4>
<p>All overnight hiking in the park requires a
backcountry use permit available free at
visitor centers, and the Cades Cove campground
kiosk. The permit system has as its
purpose to protect the unspoiled character
of the Smokies backcountry for the
enjoyment of present and future users.
Permits distribute use so that impact is
not disproportionate in popular areas, and
thus they provide backcountry users with
an opportunity for increased solitude. You
do not need a backcountry use permit for
day hiking, only for overnight use. The
&ldquo;Great Smoky Mountains Trail Map&rdquo; folder
(see <a href="#c16">above</a>) explains the permit system
and its use. Information is also available
at ranger stations or visitor centers. Or
write: Backcountry Permit, in care of the
park address; telephone (615) 436-1231
and ask for &ldquo;Backcountry.&rdquo; You can reserve
a specific backcountry campsite for one
to three specific nights up to 30 days in
advance under this permit system. You
can do this in person, by telephone, or by
<span class="pb" id="Page_116">116</span>
mail. The permit itself must be picked up
in person no earlier than 24 hours before
the beginning of the trip. <i>Note</i>: Reservations
for the entire trip are automatically
canceled if your permit is not picked up
by 12:00 noon on the first day of the
scheduled trip. Permits will not be issued
to groups larger than eight persons.</p>
<p>Competition for use of trail shelters along
popular trails is great in the peak season.
But you can pick and choose from among
many uncrowded trails that offer trailside
campsites. All water obtained in the backcountry
should be boiled or chemically
treated.</p>
<h4 id="ccc9">The Appalachian Trail</h4>
<p>Of all the distance the Appalachian Trail
spans between Maine and Georgia, perhaps
no sustained portion is as virtually
untouched by humanity as the 110 kilometers
(70 miles) threading the crest of
the Smokies. And this despite the fact
that the overall trail is 3,244 kilometers
(2,015 miles) long. You can park your car
in the Newfound Gap Parking Area and
walk the AT north or south for a pleasant
walk&mdash;or day-long hike&mdash;along the Smokies
crest. A popular destination to the north is
Charlies Bunion. There, because of unrecovered
fire openings on extremely steep
mountain slopes, you achieve a real alpine
sense and literal &ldquo;peak&rdquo; experience. You
can also park below Clingmans Dome, a
short spur drive south of Newfound Gap,
and experience the AT.</p>
<p>About every 10-16 kilometers (8 to 10
miles) there are overnight shelters providing
primitive bunks. These three-sided shelters
are closed in on the fourth side with
chainlink fence as bear-proofing. To stay
in these shelters requires a backcountry
use permit/reservation. Stays are limited
to one night at a given shelter.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig150">
<img src="images/i060.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="486" />
<p class="pcap"><i>The Appalachian Trail traces 110
kilometers (70 miles) along the
crest of the range. Overnight
shelters are screened
against bears. Shelter use requires
a backcountry use permit (see
<a href="#ccc8">text</a>). Through-hikers on the
Appalachian Trail must also write
ahead for permit information.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="img" id="fig151">

finest wildlands.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>If you are hiking the Appalachian Trail
from outside the park you can stop at the
Twentymile Ranger Station (on the south)
or the Big Creek Ranger Station (on the
north) to get your permit and reserve shelter
space. You can also write ahead for a
permit and reservation up to 30 days in
advance (see <a href="#ccc8">above</a>). For through-hikers&mdash;those
hiking the entire AT between Maine
and Georgia&mdash;the situation is different.
You can obtain a &ldquo;through permit&rdquo; in
advance of your trip. Write to Backcountry
Permits at the park address and explain
your trip.</p>
<p>Because it follows the Smokies crest the
AT acts as backbone to a network of
trails within the park. With such spur trails,
many with their own pleasant waterfall,
creek, or other natural feature as an attraction,
you have access to the AT from
numerous trailheads. Such AT sections
are much less crowded than those near
Newfound Gap and Clingmans Dome. You
get the same sense of walking the crest of
eastern America and participating in the
trail experience that began as a dream of
a pioneering land-use planner, Benton
MacKaye, early in this century.</p>
<p>For information about the complete Appalachian
Trail write The Appalachian Trail
Conference, P.O. Box 236, Harpers Ferry,
West Virginia 25425.</p>
<h4 id="ccc10">Backcountry Basics</h4>
<p>While you need a backcountry use permit
only for overnight backcountry travel, it
would be remiss not to say something
about backcountry basics for casual trail
walkers and day hikers. Once you leave a
parking area or campground in the
Smokies, you are in the wilderness. This is
the nature of the place. The National Park
Service advises against solo camping or
hiking in the backcountry. Even experienced
hikers can get into trouble and, if
alone, may not be able to obtain help.
This information is not offered to scare or
offend you, but just to make you realize
where you are and to make you concerned
about your safety.</p>
<p>Stream crossings can be dangerous if the
streams are swollen after a rainstorm. Don&rsquo;t
attempt to ford a swollen stream. Return
to the trailhead and plan another trip. It&rsquo;s
worth the extra effort and precaution.</p>
<p>Sudden weather changes are characteristic
of the Great Smokies. Be prepared to
get wet and either hotter or colder. Rain,
wind, and cold can become a deadly combination
before you recognize your own
symptoms of hypothermia. Rainstorms are
typical of warmer weather, so always carry
raingear in late spring and summer.</p>
<p>Stay on park trails. If you become lost, do
not leave the trail. Particularly, <i>do not
follow a stream</i> because dense undergrowth
will rapidly tire you. Most trails intersect
others within a few kilometers and signs
at the junctions can put you back on course.
If you find yourself lost late in the day,
find a protected spot and spend the night.
After-dark travel is dangerous. Try to stay
warm and dry. Show some sign if possible,
such as a fire.</p>
<p>Do not climb on cliff faces and waterfalls.
The fine spray mist off waterfalls makes
surrounding rocks treacherous footing and
increases safety hazards.</p>
<p>If you intend to try winter camping, write
to the superintendent for information about
the equipment you should have, a backcountry
permit, and conditions you may
encounter. At higher elevations winter
conditions can differ radically from the
popular image of winter in the mid-South.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<h4 class="interlude" id="c18"> Accommodations</h4>
<h4 id="ccc11">Camping</h4>
<p>Camping is a good way to get into the
spirit of the Great Smoky Mountains.
The National Park Service maintains
ten developed campgrounds in the park:
at Smokemont, Elkmont, Cades Cove,
Cosby, Deep Creek, Look Rock, Balsam
Mountain, Cataloochee, Big Creek,
and Abrams Creek. Fees are charged.
Campgrounds offer water, fireplaces,
tables, comfort stations, tent sites, and
limited trailer space. No shelters are
provided; bring your own and other
camping equipment. There are no showers
or trailer hookups. Disposal stations
for trailer holding tanks are found at
Smokemont, Deep Creek, Cades Cove,
and Cosby Campgrounds and across the
road from the Sugarlands Visitor Center.
Primitive campgrounds have pit
toilets.</p>
<p>Camping is limited to seven days at all campgrounds during the peak season.
You may reserve campsites at Elkmont and Cades Cove in Tennessee and
Smokemont in North Carolina by writing to Ticketron Reservations, P.O. Box
617516, Chicago, Illinois 60661-7516. Telephone reservations may be made
by calling 1-800-452-1111. For prompt
service call the national park (see <a href="#Page_101">page 101</a>) for the current per-night camping
fee and Ticketron&rsquo;s reservation handling fee. Then mail Ticketron a money order,
not a personal check, to cover the reservation plus handling for the entire
period you request. <b>General tips</b>: Avoid mid-summer&rsquo;s peak camping season.
Spring and autumn can be pleasant and offer dazzling flower and leaf-coloration
shows. Arrive early in the day and seek your campsite on arrival. Look for a
campground off the beaten path, generally away from the Newfound Gap
Road (see <a href="#c12">map</a>).</p>
<p>Chambers of commerce can supply you
with commercial camping information.
Regional lists of campgrounds are maintained
by tourist offices in both Tennessee
and North Carolina. For Tennessee
write: &ldquo;Fishing and Camping in
East Tennessee,&rdquo; Knoxville Tourist
Bureau, 500 Henley St., Knoxville, Tennessee
37901, or telephone (615) 523-2316.
For North Carolina write: &ldquo;North
Carolina Outdoors,&rdquo; Travel and Tourism
Division, 430 No. Salisbury, Raleigh,
North Carolina 27603, or telephone
(919) 733-4171.</p>
<p>LeConte Lodge lies atop Mount LeConte,
third highest Appalachian peak.
You must hike a half-day up mountain
trails to get there. Make reservations
several months in advance. The lodge
sits amidst spruce and fir trees. You
can hike in via Alum Caves Bluffs; the
lodge sits at trail junctions to Rainbow
Falls, Grotto Falls, and the Appalachian
Trail. You need bring only personal articles.

sometimes loses its normal fear of people.
This makes the bear appear tame, but it is
then actually more dangerous than its truly
wild counterparts. If you come upon a
bear while you are in your car, keep the
windows shut. Do not attempt to feed,
tease, molest, or get close to a bear. Do
not try to take a closeup portrait photograph
of a bear; either use a telephoto
lens or be satisfied with a distant shot.</p>
<p>Avoid and steer clear of a sow bear with
cubs. She will do anything to protect them
if she thinks they are threatened. Keep in
mind that, even if you don&rsquo;t see her, she is
seldom far away. Cubs are cute, but you
approach or show interest in them at your
peril.</p>
<p>Bear feeding is prohibited. It is dangerous
to you and those who come after you. It
also establishes habits that may lead to
the death of the bear. Roadside bears are
frequently hit by cars, killed by poachers,
or fed harmful substances. Don&rsquo;t be guilty
of killing a bear with kindness.</p>
<p>Campers and backpackers must observe
certain regulations designed to minimize
the extent to which bears are attracted to
human pursuits in the park. If you plan to
camp or backpack, make sure you are
familiar with these regulations on food
storage, etc. For example, food cannot be
left unattended. If you are backpacking, it
must be hung out of reach of bears. If you
are camping in a campground, food must
be stored in the trunk of your car. Ask for
additional information when you obtain
your backcountry use permit or when you
check into a campground. Failure to
observe these regulations may bring a fine.</p>
<p>Theories abound about how to act if you
should confront a bear. All such theories
assume the bear isn&rsquo;t just as startled as
you, and that &ldquo;bear behavior&rdquo; is predictable.
It is not. As many as 600 bears may
inhabit the park. This many individuals of
any highly evolved species are unlikely to
act&mdash;much less to react&mdash;with any great
predictability.</p>
<h4 id="ccc13">Hypothermia and Winter Warnings</h4>
<p>In the Smokies you must always be prepared
for sudden changes in weather, especially
as you go from one elevation to
another. Know how to take care of yourself
in extremes of cold, heat, and wetness.
Always carry rain gear because storms
arise quickly. In mid-summer at higher
elevations a wet hiker can succumb to
hypothermia, an all-weather killer. Hypothermia
is a condition in which the body
loses heat faster than it can generate it.
You cannot imagine how rapidly hypothermia
symptoms can appear even in
mild weather&mdash;until they strike you. Then
it may be too late. Know how to recognize
hypothermia&rsquo;s symptoms: uncontrolled
shivering, slurred speech, memory lapse,
fumbling hands, stumbling, drowsiness,
and inability to get up after a nap.</p>
<p>Prepare yourself against the possibility of
hypothermia by keeping a warm, dry layer
of clothing next to the body, topped with
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">121</span>
a layer to ward off wind and precipitation.
Snack often on high-energy foods and
take ample liquids. In winter wear multiple
layers of insulating clothing under your
top layer of rain and wind protection.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>The timber

</div>
<p>Remember that hypothermia strikes in
any season, not just winter. Winter hazards
include frostbite; icy trails and deep
snow; and trails obscured by deep snow.</p>
<h4 id="ccc14">Management Regulations</h4>
<p>Drive safely, observing posted speed limits,
and pull off the road or park only at
designated areas. Do not leave valuables
inside a locked car where they can be
seen. Leave them home, take them with
you when you leave your car, or lock
them in the trunk.</p>
<p>Hunting is prohibited in the park. Firearms
must be broken down so they cannot
be used. The use of archery equipment,
game calls, and spotlights is also prohibited.</p>
<p>All plants, animals, and artifacts are protected
by Federal law here. Do not disturb
them in any way. Fishing is permitted
subject to State and Federal regulation
and licensing.</p>
<p>All overnight camping in the backcountry
requires a backcountry permit. Otherwise,
camp and build fires only in designated
campground sites.</p>
<p><b>A Word About Pets.</b> It is best not to bring
pets. They are permitted in the park but
only if on a leash or under other physical
control at all times. They may not be
taken on trails or cross-country hikes. Veterinary
services are found in nearby towns.
If you want to board your pet during your
stay here, check with the chambers of
commerce in nearby cities.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<h4 class="interlude" id="c20"> Nearby Attractions</h4>
<p>To describe the many attractions near the
Smokies would require an encyclopedic
guidebook. Nearby are TVA&rsquo;s &ldquo;Great Lakes
of the South,&rdquo; Biltmore House and Gardens,
large national forests, Oak Ridge&rsquo;s
American Museum of Science and Energy,
and other features too numerous to
mention. Here are just a few features often
associated with a Smokies vacation.</p>
<p><b>The Blue Ridge Parkway.</b> From the northeast
the Blue Ridge Parkway makes a
delightful highway approach to the Smokies
on the North Carolina side. The parkway
is administered by the National Park Service
and connects Shenandoah National
Park, Virginia, with the Great Smoky
Mountains National Park. It meticulously
follows the southern Appalachians for 755
kilometers (469 miles). It is a roadway
designed for motor recreation and so provides
leisurely travel free of commercial
development. All along it are trails and
scenic viewpoints. In season, wildflowers
and fall colors can be stupendous. Just
before the parkway reaches the Smokies
it enters the Balsam Mountains, from which
you look directly across at the Smokies.
Just after Soco Gap on the parkway you
can turn almost due north onto a spur
road into the national park&rsquo;s Balsam Mountain
Campground and its Heintooga Overlook
area.</p>

<p><b>The Gateway Cities.</b> For many people a
trip to the Smokies is not complete without
taking in the sights of Pigeon Forge,
Townsend, and/or Gatlinburg, Tennessee,
or Bryson City or Cherokee, North Carolina.
At either end of U.S. 441 these municipalities
go all-out to serve the tourist trade.
Restaurants and motels are major industries
along with curio shops, art galleries,
and the theme villages that characterize
our American tourist scene.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>The Blue Ridge Parkway has its

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>Taken together these surrounding municipalities
offer most facilities and services
you might need during your stay in the
Smokies. Cameras and photographic supplies,
groceries, pharmacies, local literature
and guides, banks, and countless other
services are available.</p>
<p>Cherokee Indian Heritage. The Cherokee
Indian Reservation abuts the park
boundary on the southeast. In Cherokee
there are museums and shops where the
art and crafts of these eastern woodlands
Indians, thought to be of original Iroquoian
stock, are displayed and offered for sale.
Each year a play, &ldquo;Unto These Hills,&rdquo; is
performed locally. It describes the Cherokee&rsquo;s
history and early encounters with
Europeans. Most of these activities occur
on the North Carolina side of the park.</p>
<p>Mountain Folkways and Crafts. Mountain
ingenuity and the human bent for creativity
gave rise to crafts characteristic of the
southern mountains. These are kept alive
in various outlets surrounding the Smokies.
In Gatlinburg you can visit the famed
Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts,
which has done so much to revive original
handicraft arts and support the artists by
marketing their work.</p>

<h4 id="ccc15">Some Books You May Want to Read</h4>
<p>The Great Smoky Mountains and their
national park are both rich in lore, much
of which has been collected and committed
to print over the years. Your appreciation
of a trip to these mountains can
be greatly enhanced, both before and after,
by reading accounts of the area&rsquo;s history,
natural history, and folklore. There are
also field identification guides to nearly
everything you see here, from rocks and
flowers to spiders and mammals. And
there are trail and hiking guidebooks full
of good tips and advice on interesting
trips, both day trips and overnights. Listed
here are selected titles usually available
for purchase at park visitor centers, or to
be found in your public library. Many of
these may also be purchased in bookstores
in communities near the park. Several
interesting and useful maps of the area are
also available. For a more complete list
of publications write to the Great Smoky
Mountains Natural History Association,
Gatlinburg, Tennessee 37738. This nonprofit
association maintains a sales list
of technical and other books about the
Smokies as part of its efforts to enhance
the interpretation of the park&rsquo;s values to
the public.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
